<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">For</span> those who have no knowledge of the ways
and habits of submarines, a preface is unnecessary,
and my only hope is that this book may enlighten
them on points on which they were formerly in
ignorance. One is often asked, ‘What does it feel
like to be below the sea?’ and a host of questions
of a similar character, and it is just these questions
that I have endeavoured to answer. The incidents
recorded are all founded on fact, and many of
them are personal experiences.</p>

<p>Of my one-time comrades of the Submarine
Service, however, I have a favour to ask. I beg
them not to be too critical nor to point out its
deficiencies, but rather to remember that this
book was written while the War was still with us,
and that a large amount of detail had therefore
to be omitted.</p>

<p>Moreover, the boat described is of one particular
class, and if they themselves have never served
in that class of submarine, ‘more’s the pity.’</p>

<p>All luck to our successors in the next war, and
may they fight in the open air.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFATORY_NOTE">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Mr Bennett’s</span> admirable book tells us of the
officers and men of the Submarine Service and of
the working of that wonderful vessel, the submarine.
The author served throughout the war as an
officer in H.M.S. submarine No.——, so that he writes
of his own knowledge. Mr Bennett is a professional
sailor; when he is not fighting for king and country
he is an officer in His Majesty’s Mercantile Marine;
and yet there is many a professional writer who
may envy Mr Bennett’s skill in the craft of writing.
As a rule, the man who does things is the least
capable of writing about them; but when he
can write, he is best of all. And of such is
Mr Bennett.</p>

<p>The naval architect, when (in a rash moment)
he gave the submarine to the Royal Navy, offered
a new and a perilous enterprise to the indomitable
spirit of the seaman. How that enterprise is
achieved, with what courage, endurance, cheerfulness,
enthusiasm, with what extraordinary skill,
Mr Bennett tells us with a seamanlike modesty
and precision. The task set to the Navy was how
to wield a new weapon, an invisible weapon
striking with the torpedo. It was not until 1910
that a British submarine went without escort
into deep water and proved her capacity to cruise
and fight as an independent unit. During the
war, we heard a deal of the German submarine,
and very little of our own Submarine Service.
Mr Bennett narrates the story of one submarine,
and in so doing, informs us more vividly and
truly than all the official reports can ever
inform us.</p>

<p>With the submarine, Germany very nearly
defeated the entire British Navy, but not quite.
The difference between victory and failure resided
not in the submarine, which is machinery, but
in the officers and men. Had the positions
been reversed: had the British held the German
strategical position, had the Germans owned the
British Grand Fleet; there would have been very
little left of that tremendous armada ere six months
were over. The submarine, handled as Mr Bennett
describes, has in fact made an end of the old
Navy.</p>

<p>There is now the Navy that swims, the Navy
that flies, and the Navy that dives. These three
are one: and into what this triple machine will
evolve, none knows. But it is enough to know
something of the quality of the officers and men,
for these are the masters of the machine.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">His</span> Majesty’s Submarine ‘123’ lay alongside her
depot ship <i>Parentis</i>, her lean, gray superstructure
showing up ghostly white against the dark outline
of the larger vessel.</p>

<p>The night was warm, though dark and overcast,
and the light south-easterly breeze merely ruffled
the waters of the harbour, causing a lap-lapping
noise between the two vessels, the only sound
that broke the intense silence of the summer night.</p>

<p>As the great fleet, anchored in the harbour,
swung to the turn of the tide, ‘123’ exposed her
broadside, a long low hull bulging outwards at
the centre, and supporting the superstructure, on
the fore part of which the gun was mounted. Amidships
rose the conning-tower and the little bridge,
the standard and the two periscopes, pointing up
to Heaven like the fingers of an avenging angel.</p>

<p>The after deck was bare save for the dark rings
of the hatches, leading down to her steel internals.</p>

<p>The anchored fleet showed up in dark blurs
and splotches, as far as the eye could see. Line
after line of battleships, battle cruisers, destroyers
and torpedo boats, backed up by a host of merchant
ships of every type and size.</p>

<p>A light gleamed suddenly from the submarine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
faded away, flashed out, and disappeared. Figures
moved quietly along the deck, and the sound of
subdued voices rose, broken now and then by the
clump of a wet rope’s end or the clang of a closing
deck locker.</p>

<p>Then the conning-tower hatch opened and Lieut.
Commander John Raymond, R.N., in command of
H.M. Submarine ‘123,’ rose to view, heaving
himself through the narrow opening by painful
sections.</p>

<p>He was a big, strongly-built man of about thirty-three,
clad in an old—a very old—suit of uniform,
a muffler, sea-boots, a pair of binoculars, and his
own inborn modesty.</p>

<p>After him came the navigator, an R.N.R. Lieutenant,
lovingly clasping the gyro compass repeater
to his bosom, and muttering imprecations the
while on the coil of electric cable which trailed up
after him like a spider’s web.</p>

<p>‘Phew!’ he said, sniffing the air. ‘Dark night.’</p>

<p>The captain glanced quickly fore and aft.</p>

<p>‘All ready, coxswain?’ he queried.</p>

<p>A burly figure now loomed up on the now crowded
conning-tower.</p>

<p>‘All ready, sir.’</p>

<p>Raymond leant down and pulled a lanyard,
and a bell rang below in the control room.</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ boomed a voice as a face appeared in the
circle of the hatch.</p>

<p>‘All ready below?’</p>

<p>‘All ready, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>‘Group down?’<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>‘Grouped down, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Let go fore and aft,’ cried Raymond to the
waiting men on the superstructure.</p>

<p>‘All gone, sir.’</p>

<p>At the fore part of the conning-tower a small
pedestal rose containing the magnetic compass
and steering gear and a number of small switches.</p>

<p>Raymond pressed two of these and a hooter or
‘Klaxon Horn’ sounded below, a bell rang, and
the twin screws began to revolve.</p>

<p>‘Astern both it is. Helm amidships.’</p>

<p>‘’Midships, sir,’ from the coxswain.</p>

<p>‘Keep a look out aft, Boyd,’ said Raymond,
turning to the navigator.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir,’ came the answer, then ‘all clear
aft, sir.’</p>

<p>‘The Klaxon’s sounded again.’</p>

<p>‘Ahead starboard, astern port. Hard-a-starboard!’
snapped Raymond.</p>

<p>‘Hard over, sir,’ chorused the coxswain.</p>

<p>‘123’ stopped coming astern, gathered herself
together, and then slowly surged ahead and swung
round as sedately as a dowager.</p>

<p>‘Stop port. Ahead port,’ snorted the ‘Klaxon.’</p>

<p>‘’Midships,’ from Raymond. ‘Steady. Take
her out.’</p>

<p>‘Take her out, sir.’</p>

<p>The boat steadied on her course and travelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
silently down the harbour on her electric motors,
carefully picking her way between the dark shapes
of the anchored vessels.</p>

<p>Conversation on the bridge was at a premium.
Tempers are apt to be short and livers out of order
at one o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Presently Raymond looked ahead through his
binoculars and jerked the bell lanyard impatiently.</p>

<p>‘Group up!’ he called down the shaft.</p>

<p>‘Grouped up, sir,’ came the answer.</p>

<p>The subdued churning of the twin screws ceased
and as suddenly started with redoubled energy
as the batteries came in series, thrashing up the
water astern and causing the boat to vibrate fore
and aft as she leapt forward to the touch of the
grouper switch.</p>

<p>Down in the electric lit interior the L.T.O.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
and an S.T.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> were working the motor switches,
‘making and breaking’ in obedience to the telegraph
lights, to which the ‘Claxtons’ called attention.
Right aft in the engine-room the Chief
E.R.A.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> was hovering over the tail shafts with an
oil can and a lump of dirty waste, with the air of
a demon of the revels.</p>

<p>Forward of him were the air compressors and
main motors, and the engine clutches, and then
the great eight-cylinder Diesel engines, a mass of
burnished steel and brasswork in a narrow electric
lit tunnel. The faint hum of the motors and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
smell of fuel oil pervaded the air, but the cheery
faces of the stokers on watch robbed the scene of
its romance.</p>

<p>One of them who was whistling ‘Tennessee’ three
tones flat, and bending over a clutch with a dignified
expression, straightened up as a man came down the
engine-room hatch.</p>

<p>‘’Ere, Sam, you remember that gell wot——’
he began.</p>

<p>‘’Strewth,’ quoth the new-comer. ‘Ain’t it got
dark sudden?’</p>

<p>‘It usually does,’ broke in another voice from
behind the engine, ‘at night-time.’</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t remember any gall,’ replied Sam
with some asperity; ‘and wot’s more, if that clutch
ain’t ready pretty damn soon, you’ll be spoke to.’</p>

<p>‘Way down in Tennessee——’ continued the
worker, ignoring the insult, in a masterly manner.</p>

<p>Through the door in the engine-room bulkhead
came the Chief E.R.A. to hurl an insult at a tardy
message-bearer, but the hoot of the telegraph
sent him diving back to his lair almost immediately.</p>

<p>‘Stop ’er,’ cried the L.T.O., working the switches
to the accompaniment of a hiss and crackle of
blue sparks.</p>

<p>‘Engines!’ came Raymond’s voice from above.
‘Three hundred revs.!’</p>

<p>‘Engines!’ shouted Furness, the L.T.O., into
the engine-room. ‘Three ’undred!’</p>

<p>‘The ‘Chief’ waved a reply, and with a snip of
switches the motors started again. Then the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
engine clutches came home and the Diesels began
to heave with a fizz bump, fizz bump, fizz, fizz,
fizz, as the needles of the ammeters came back
from discharging, past zero and on to charging.</p>

<p>Once more Hoskins waved a grimy hand and
the motor workers broke their switches. She was
away on her engines at ten knots now, her exhaust,
which had started in oily puffs, rapidly thinning
astern to a white semi-transparent vapour.</p>

<p>Into the battery-room at this juncture came
the ‘Sub’ of the boat, an ingenuous youth of
nineteen, bearing upon his youthful shoulders
as second in command all the anxieties and troubles
of the world.</p>

<p>‘All right, Furness?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Yessir, she went off very well.’</p>

<p>‘Good,’ replied Seagrave, looking at the volt-metre
on the low-power switchboard. ‘Keep the
lighting down to a hundred and ten.’</p>

<p>He wandered off under the mess tables, clipped
up to the steel ceiling of the compartment to
examine the gyro master-compass, a large mushroom-shaped
object of steel and electricity, whose
rotor buzzed round at the rate of over eight
thousand revolutions a minute.</p>

<p>On his left were the electric cooking range,
lockers and battery ventilators, and overhead
were the great vents which let the air out of the
main ballast tanks when the boat dived.</p>

<p>Presently, satisfied with the ‘Sperry’ compass,
he stepped forward through the watertight door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
into the control room, a regular holy of holies, on
whose shrine were offered many tins of ‘Brasso’
daily and much elbow grease and bad language
by heated and voluble ‘matlows.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Here were the levers which opened the great
Kingston valves in the bottom of the boat and
flooded the tanks for diving. Here was the adjusting
pump, by means of which water could be
pumped from any one tank to another and into
or from the sea. Aft was the periscope, a long
steel tube sticking up through the roof, fitted with
an eye-piece and graduated rings at its lower end.
On the port side were the hydroplane and diving
rudder wheels, and the depth and pressure gauges.
Forward was the air manifold, by means of which,
on opening the Kingston valves, air could be
blown into the tanks at a pressure of over 75 lbs.
to the square inch, and so force the water out of
them when the captain wished the boat to rise.</p>

<p>In the centre, up through the ceiling, was the
conning-tower shaft, gained by a steel ladder,
above which was another periscope and the torpedo
firing gear.</p>

<p>Another watertight door led into the fore compartment
where the battery-ventilating fans were
running, and the ceiling was interlaced with the
usual profusion of vents and shafts. Right aft
an operator was tuning the wireless installation,
beyond which were the crew’s lockers and the
flag racks. On the port side was the chart table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
and two bunks, one high up, and the other formed
by a drawer, which on being pulled out and stayed
up, disclosed the bedding all neatly stowed away.
Underfoot, as in the after compartment, was the
great hundred-and-twenty volt battery which fed
the hungry motors, and forward were the air
bottles and fuel tanks.</p>

<p>In the bows were the torpedo-tubes, whose
brass doors winked in the electric light, hiding the
wicked torpedoes behind their shining faces. A
turn of the bow cap and a pull at a lever, and
they would be off at forty knots to reap a harvest
of death and destruction. Abaft the tubes were
spare torpedoes, shining steel cylinders with copper
war-heads, holding sufficient T.N.T. to sink a
Dreadnought.</p>

<p>The men were moving quietly about their work,
the watch below preparing to turn in while the
remainder were cleaning and adjusting and getting
ready generally for the coming sea trip.</p>

<p>Once out of the harbour, ‘123’ lifted gently to
the swell, and with her hydroplanes turned out
and all hatches closed, with the exception of that
from the conning-tower, was cutting through the
water like a great porpoise.</p>

<p>By now the crew had settled down to sea routine,
and only the captain, navigator, and coxswain were
on the conning-tower bridge, and an occasional
seaman or stoker up for a breather or smoke-oh.</p>

<p>Boyd, who had been looking aft intently, lowered
his binoculars and glanced at the compass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>‘Bearing’s on, sir,’ he reported. ‘Course is
fifty-six.’</p>

<p>‘All right. Steer fifty-six. That’ll do, coxswain.
Helmsman to the wheel.’</p>

<p>The coxswain was relieved and bustled below,
and a young A.B. took the wheel, or rather the
electric switch which, by a movement of the finger,
altered the direction of the ship’s head.</p>

<p>‘Wonder if we’ll see anything this time,’ continued
the skipper. ‘Fritz doesn’t seem to be
over-anxious about coming out lately. I never
seem to have any luck, but he’ll be a nasty customer
to tackle if ever we do run across him. He won’t
give in while he’s got a kick left in him.’</p>

<p>‘Gets a bit monotonous,’ admitted Boyd. ‘My
brother’s in France. Sometimes I wish I were
out there too. They do see something of the
scrapping at any rate. What gets on my nerves
is this constant being on the alert and never seeing
anything. If you were told you were to go out
and strafe a Hun one wouldn’t mind. It’s the
uncertainty of the business that shakes me.’</p>

<p>‘Now, I can’t allow you to complain of your lot,’
replied Raymond. ‘Here you are in one of the
latest inventions of the twentieth century, and
even that doesn’t satisfy you. When you have
met George Willie in his little sardine tin you
won’t be quite so anxious.’</p>

<p>‘Two o’clock,’ he continued, glancing at his
watch. ‘We’ll dive at half-past five. Call me at
a quarter past.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>‘All right. I’ll stop up till then. No need to
wake Seagrave.’</p>

<p>Raymond’s legs disappeared down the hatch.</p>

<p>‘Call me if you see anything,’ he said as he went
down, ‘and if you should run across Fritz, man the
gun and Hun him instanter. I’ll be up before you
get the first round off.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir. Good-night.’</p>

<p>‘Good-night.’ And the captain vanished below,
like a stage demon down a trap.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Boyd lit a pipe, took a look
round with the glasses and peered into the compass,
where a thin circle of light showed up the figures
on its face.</p>

<p>The night was clear now for the clouds had rolled
away, but it was still very dark. All round was
the dark rim of the horizon, and just below, quite
close, was the greedy ocean, lapping up over the
superstructure as the boat hurried on. The stars
gleamed tranquilly and the night seemed very
still.</p>

<p>A queer feeling this, with only the helmsman
and the click of the gyro compass for company;
like being adrift on the open sea in a small motor-boat.
Darkness and the faint chug-chug of the
engines leant an eeriness to the situation, and the
proximity of the water only added to its intensity.
Down through the hatch Boyd could see a small
circle of the control room, where a messenger was
sitting on a camp-stool reading a penny magazine
with evident enjoyment. Above and all around,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
nature and solitude; below, men, the smell of cocoa,
the engines of death and ... a penny magazine.</p>

<p>The watch dragged slowly on, and Boyd, seated
on the little round stool screwed into the deck,
began to feel the chilliness of the dawn. He rose
and commenced pacing the ‘bridge.’</p>

<p>Not much room to walk here, for the periscope
standard rose abaft the conning-tower hatch, and
beyond that were the bridge berthing wires. Three
steps and turn. Three steps and turn....</p>

<p>Then suddenly a broad white finger of light
shot up over the horizon on the port bow, cleaving
the darkness with an eerie suddenness.</p>

<p>Boyd rang the bell.</p>

<p>‘Tell the captain that a searchlight is visible
from the enemy coast,’ he called to the messenger
in the control room.</p>

<p>A minute’s pause, the light wavered, steadied,
and went out.</p>

<p>‘Captain says all right, sir,’ came the voice up
the hatch.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ replied Boyd, relighting his pipe
and settling down on the stool again.</p>

<p>The boat sped on through the darkness. Somewhere
away ahead, as evidenced by that broad
beam of light, lay the hostile coast towards which
the lean, grim-looking craft was racing as fast as
Heaven and Hoskins could make her go.</p>

<p>A brawny stoker rose for a breath of air like
some giant seal, and, in deference to the officer,
took his stand on the other side of the bridge. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
was followed by the signalman, and the two men
lit their pipes and conversed in low tones.</p>

<p>Not much room up here for four men; the little
bridge was crowded now.</p>

<p>When they had gone down, Boyd rang the bell
again and muttered the magic words, ‘food and
cocoa,’ to the face that appeared in the circle of
light below, and presently a hand shot up out of
the hatch bearing a steaming mug which he hastily
relieved of its burden.</p>

<p>The hand disappeared and returned with a
biscuit-tin, and finally vanished altogether.</p>

<p>The dawn was now paling the eastern sky, and
the wedge of fore-deck began to take shape and
harden as the light gained strength. The faint
glow in the compass died out, and the coast ahead
became visible: a distant, mountainous country,
looking menacing in the struggling dawn.</p>

<p>The navigator pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>‘Five o’clock,’ he muttered. ‘Better get a star
sight before diving.’</p>

<p>Telling the helmsman to ring the bell if he saw
anything, he went below into the control room,
where the thump and bang of the engines smothered
all other sounds, and through into the fore compartment,
treading lightly and dodging under
the hammocks and over the sleeping men stretched
out on the deck.</p>

<p>Passing through the long green curtains, he
stepped into that space dignified by the high-sounding
name of ‘Ward Room,’ where Seagrave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and Raymond were sleeping, and culling from a
drawer his sextant and a watch, returned on deck.</p>

<p>By the time he had taken his sights the dawn
was well advanced, and after a careful look round
the horizon he once more rang the bell.</p>

<p>‘Call the captain and tell him it’s five-fifteen, please.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir.’</p>

<p>Presently Raymond came up and took a long
look at the distant coast.</p>

<p>‘Well, young feller,’ he said, lowering his glasses,
‘seen anything?’</p>

<p>‘Not so as you’d notice it,’ replied Boyd. ‘That
light only showed up for five minutes or so. I got
some sights by the way, as the land’s too far off
for decent bearings.’</p>

<p>‘What you’ll suffer from, my lad,’ said Raymond
with a grin, ‘is sextantitis if you carry on as you’re
doing now. It’s a very common complaint among
R.N.R. Lieutenants, and comes from the constant
habit of taking sights. The patient rises at one
in the morning and tries to find his latitude with
a hambone and a piece of string.’</p>

<p>‘Better to be sure than sorry, anyway,’ answered
Boyd.</p>

<p>‘Well, you brought it on yourself. If you only
knew what an effort it costs me to be funny at
this hour in the morning you wouldn’t ask for it.
I tell you it completely defeats me. When we get
back I shall have to take a course of something,
or drink unpleasant mixtures out of green bottles.’</p>

<p>‘If it’s whisky you mean I can quite believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
you,’ returned Boyd, with his legs down the hatch.
‘Well, so she goes. Course fifty-six. Fine weather
and no fish.’</p>

<p>‘Give Seagrave a shake when you get below,’ the
skipper called after him. ‘Tell him I’m going to
dive in ten minutes.’</p>

<p>‘Achchha, Sahib,’ and Boyd vanished below.</p>

<p>Raymond sat down and lit a pipe, keeping a
careful look-out over the oily swell of smooth water.
Presently he pressed the telegraph switches and
the engines stopped.</p>

<p>‘Diving stations!’ he ordered. ‘Shut off for
diving! Lower deck control!’</p>

<p>‘Both engine clutches out, sir,’ bellowed a voice
from below.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay,’ returned the skipper, and then turning
to the <span class="locked">helmsman,—</span></p>

<p>‘Down below,’ he added.</p>

<p>The sailor closed the magnetic compass lid and
screwed it well home, unshipped the gyro repeater
and decamped to continue his task at the steering
position in the control room.</p>

<p>Raymond took a final look round, and collecting
the spare glasses and all the odd gear about the
bridge, clambered down the conning-tower, shutting
the lid after him, and screwing the strong back well
into position. On the order ‘Diving stations,’ the
scene below had become one of ordered confusion.
Every man had his own station and duty to
perform, both when diving and rising, and by the
time Raymond got below all was ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>Hoskins, the Chief E.R.A., was at the air manifold,
ready to let the air out of the smaller tanks
and so admit the water.</p>

<p>The L.T.O. and an S.T. stood by to start the
motors, while the remainder were closing battery
ventilators, giving a final wrench at a hatch
batten, and standing by the great vent valves.
Forward the T.I.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> was fussing over a tube door,
while in the engine-room the E.R.A.’s and
stokers were saying soothing words to the silent
engines.</p>

<p>Over all this Seagrave reigned supreme. This
was his ‘pidgeon,’ and he ran his crew of twenty-three
with the capability of a veteran in spite of
his youthful appearance.</p>

<p>Boyd sat working out his sights. He didn’t
come into this part of the business.</p>

<p>‘Shut off for diving, sir,’ came a voice from the
engine-room, and ‘All ready, sir,’ from Seagrave.</p>

<p>The captain pressed a small switch and the
periscope slid upwards till its lower end was at a
comfortable height. He applied his eye to it and
looked carefully round.</p>

<p>The voice of the musical stoker filtered in from
the <span class="locked">engine-room,—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>
<p>‘You shut yer ’ead,’ came the answer. ‘Pity
you ain’t got more to do <span class="locked">than——’</span></p>

<p>‘Flood 1 and 4,’ ordered Raymond.</p>

<p>‘Open 1 and 4 Kingstons and 1 and 4 main
vents!’ shouted Seagrave.</p>

<p>Two stokers wrenched back the Kingston levers,
while a couple of seamen reached up and screwed
open the vent valves. The coxswain and second
coxswains took their stand by the hydroplane
and diving rudder wheels.</p>

<p>‘Flood 2.’</p>

<p>‘Open No. 2 Kingston and No. 2 main vent,’
from the ‘Sub.’</p>

<p>A hiss and a spurt of water came from the air
manifold, and Hoskins looked over his shoulder
as he worked at the spindles.</p>

<p>‘1 and 4 full, sir,’ he reported.</p>

<p>A slight cant forward could now be felt in the
boat as the tanks filled and she settled down in
the water.</p>

<p>‘How is she, coxswain?’ asked Raymond with
his eye still at the periscope.</p>

<p>‘Three degrees by the head, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Right. Flood 3.’</p>

<p>‘Open No. 3 Kingston and No. 3 main vent.
Close 1 and 4 vents!’ cried Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘Vents closed, sir,’ came the reports.</p>

<p>‘2 full, sir,’ said Hoskins. A pause, and then
‘3 full, sir,’ he added.</p>

<p>‘How is she now, coxswain?’ asked the captain
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>‘Two degrees by the stern, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. Close main vents. Another 500
in the fore trim, Seagrave.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir; 500 in the fore-trim,’ repeated the
‘Sub.’</p>

<p>‘Horizontal, sir,’ from the coxswain.</p>

<p>The needle of the depth-gauge trembled, moved
slowly, reached four feet and stopped.</p>

<p>‘Four feet,’ announced Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘That’ll do,’ replied Raymond. ‘10,000 in the
auxiliary and flood the buoyancy.’</p>

<p>The depth-needle shivered and crept on to
‘fifteen.’</p>

<p>‘How is she?’ asked the captain again.</p>

<p>‘Horizontal, sir, fifteen feet,’ replied the coxswain.</p>

<p>‘Start the motors. Full fields,’ ordered Raymond.
‘Thirty feet. Take her down.’</p>

<p>The two coxswains spun their wheels forward
with eyes glued on the depth-gauge.</p>

<p>The needle moved slowly on. Twenty, twenty-five,
twenty-seven feet, it recorded. They were
whirling their wheels aft now to check her from
going too deep.</p>

<p>Thirty feet, thirty-two, thirty-four the metre
registered, and then slowly the needle swung back
a little and stopped.</p>

<p>‘Thirty feet, sir,’ said the coxswain.</p>

<p>‘Right. Crack the vents and let me know if
she gets heavy,’ replied the captain, lowering the
periscope. ‘Finished diving stations.’</p>

</div>

<p class="in0">floated forward again.</p>

<p>Raymond smiled as he watched the men leaving
their posts. A humorist in a boat is worth his
weight in gold.</p>

<p>The crew dispersed about their various jobs,
some to continue their watch in the engine-room
or at the wheels, while the watch below turned
in their hammocks or stretched out on deck,
leaving a courteous gangway to the curtained-off
space, anywhere they could find room for a
blanket and pillow.</p>

<p>The second coxswain set the diving rudders,
spat on his hands, bit off a chunk of tobacco, and
retired aft. She would do now, and the coxswain
alone could keep her at her depth with the hydroplanes,
the great horizontal rudders at the fore-end
of the boat that steered her up or down in
the same manner as an ordinary vertical rudder
steers a surface ship to left or right.</p>

<p>Raymond spent a few minutes satisfying himself
that all was well and the helmsman on his course,
and then stepped through into the fore-compartment
and looked at the chart.</p>

<p>Seagrave and Boyd had both turned in, and
in the ‘Ward Room’ it seemed strangely silent.
When on the surface the thump and bang of the
Diesels filled the boat, and down below one could
always hear the water lapping over the superstructure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and feel the vibration and general sense
of resistance and energy. But now she was submerged
there was an intense stillness, a sort of
dead stillness, and only the faint hum of the motors
indicated that she was under weigh. There was
no motion, no vibration, and no feeling of strain
or energy. She might have been at anchor in
harbour, except that the hatches were closed and
the steering chain rattled now and again.</p>

<p>At one moment noise and rushing water, the
next, ‘Diving stations!’ a clang, a hiss or two,
and ... silence.</p>

<p>The men’s voices drifted in from the after-compartment,
and the clatter of knives and forks
indicated that the cook was getting breakfast
ready.</p>

<p>After a while Raymond went back to the control
room, inhabited now by only the coxswain and
helmsman.</p>

<p>‘Eighteen feet,’ he said.</p>

<p>The coxswain spun his wheel until the depth-needles
steadied once more.</p>

<p>‘Eighteen feet, sir,’ he announced.</p>

<p>At this depth the lowered periscope was just
below the surface of the water and still invisible
from above. The captain pressed the switch and
it slid up to its required height, bringing its upper
lens about three feet above the surface, a thin
brass cylinder being all that was apparent to any
hostile craft.</p>

<p>With his eye to the lens at the lower end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
Raymond obtained a view much like that seen
through ordinary binoculars.</p>

<p>As he turned the instrument round he could
see the horizon and the wake of the periscope
lying astern in creamy bubbles, then the enemy
coast about twenty miles away filling the whole
of his view to the eastward, then a glimpse of his
own hydroplanes, again the horizon and the circle
was complete.</p>

<p>Nothing in sight. He lowered the periscope,
and giving the order ‘thirty feet,’ returned to the
fore-compartment and sat down by the chart-table
with a magazine.</p>

<p>Every ten minutes he went back to the control
room, the boat rose to eighteen feet, the periscope
was hoisted, and he took his careful survey. Then
down to the patrolling depth again and back he
went to the silent ‘Ward Room’ to glance at the
chart or anything that would pass the time.</p>

<p>Towards eight o’clock, the cook came forward
to ask Raymond what time he wanted breakfast.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ answered the skipper laconically, picking
up the dividers and sticking them into Seagrave’s
leg, as the cook departed.</p>

<p>The sleeper grunted and turned over.</p>

<p>‘Wake up, young feller,’ said Raymond. ‘Don’t
you want any breakfast?’</p>

<p>The ‘Sub.’ sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lord!’ he groaned. ‘Why can’t you leave
a chap alone?’</p>

<p>‘Come on now; it’s good for children, invalids,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
and the aged. Shake a leg and let’s get that table
out.’</p>

<p>Seagrave staggered over to the folding basin.</p>

<p>‘As usual,’ he grumbled, ‘no bally water now,
and I can’t see out of my eyes till I’ve had a wash.’</p>

<p>‘My goodness, you do look a picture of a promising
young officer,’ grinned Raymond, ‘and let me
tell you, you wash far too often. None of the
really classy people in submarines ever wash.
When I was up the Marmora I didn’t wash for a
month.’</p>

<p>‘Nor since, either, I should imagine,’ retorted
Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘This flippancy in one of tender years is very
galling. You don’t follow my august example.
Look at Boyd, for instance. Gets out of his bunk
as if he were going to be Queen of the May.’</p>

<p>Between them they pushed in the lower bunk
and hauled out a table flap, on which the meal was
laid by the cook, who bore in the eggs and sausages
with the air of one who has achieved a culinary
triumph.</p>

<p>‘Just look at those sausages,’ said Seagrave
sitting down. ‘They look as if they’d spent their
palmier days on a cab rank.’</p>

<p>‘You’ve been spoilt,’ replied the skipper. ‘You’ve
been brought up on Service bangers, and now you
think that our best Vienna sausages, provided by
me at great personal expense, are beneath you.’</p>

<p>‘I’d have been glad enough to see any sort of
sausages when I was apprentice in a wind-jammer,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
put in Boyd. ‘Cracker hash was what we got.
However, I don’t blame you. If I felt like you
look, I don’t think I <em>could</em> eat a fried egg.’</p>

<p>‘A most appalling example of a youthful officer
on his way to the bow-wows,’ put in Raymond.
‘Eighteen feet.’</p>

<p>The meal over, Seagrave went aft to look at
his beloved motors and engines, while the captain
and navigator consulted the chart.</p>

<p>‘Near enough to the land, I think,’ said Raymond;
‘we don’t know exactly where their minefields
are. We’ll steer an opposite course till
noon.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir. Steer 236 deg., helmsman.’</p>

<p>‘236 deg., sir,’ came the reply as the wheel went
over, and a little <span class="locked">later,—</span></p>

<p>‘Course, sir?’</p>

<p>‘All “Sir Garnet” in the engine-room,’ announced
Seagrave, returning from his tour of
inspection. ‘The batteries are still up to twelve
twenty-five.’</p>

<p>Raymond nodded approval.</p>

<p>‘That’s the sort. Hard-working ‘Subs’ of boats
a pace forward, march! One of our world’s
workers, but died before attaining maturity. All
the same this new battery of ours seems pretty
good.’</p>

<p>‘What always scares me,’ returned the other,
‘is shutting down the ventilators for diving. I
know I shall forget it some day, and then we’ll
have chlorine gas in the boat and be as cold as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
haddocks in about five minutes, like those poor
beggars in “164.”’</p>

<p>‘The day you feel that coming on, you want to
let me know. Suicidal mania is not one of my
deficiencies. You let me know beforehand and
I’ll have you hanged, drawn, and quartered, and
bits of you hung round the superstructure as a
warning to others of the awful fate of ‘Subs’
who feel the first symptoms of incipient lunacy
approaching.’</p>

<p>‘What was it happened to “159” last trip,
by the way?’ put in Boyd.</p>

<p>‘Oh, it wasn’t much,’ replied Raymond.
‘“Snatcher” told me about it. They were having
tea at about thirty feet when they heard a rumbling
stunt. He took her down to eighty feet and
stopped there till he had recovered from the fit
of nervous prostration into which he had been
thrown. Then he went down to a hundred and
twenty, took the opportunity of going round and
seeing if the boat was right at that depth. When
he was satisfied he came up and kept her at forty-five
for the rest of the patrol.’</p>

<p>‘What was it?’ queried Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘Seaplane bomb dropped from right above,
and only just missed ’em. It was a smooth day,
and the pilot must have been able to see the boat
easily. The joke was that the stoker P.O., who was
off watch at the time, was asleep, with his head
against the skin of the hull, and when the bomb
went off, the vibration of the boat’s side gave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
a lump on the back of the chump as big as an
ostrich egg.’</p>

<p>‘Interesting and instructive experience,’ remarked
Boyd. ‘Honest Herbert harried by the
Hun! That’s the reason there wasn’t any gin in
the boat yesterday. The shock to the nerves
must have been too much for them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘Let the Hun pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though he’s an ass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I warrant he’ll prove an excuse for the glass.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Seagrave, ‘I heard “Bunty”
trying to cadge a bottle off the mess-man before
we left. But it wasn’t any good. He pleaded
that they might meet a “U” boat this time, and
that after they’d finished her off they wouldn’t
have anything to celebrate the event in. Then he
tried strategy, and told the mess-man that he was
positive all the German boats were well supplied,
on the off-chance of strafing one of our “E”
boats.’</p>

<p>‘What did the mess-man say?’</p>

<p>‘Said “U” stood for ’Un and “E” for England,
and handed him his mess bill, plus extras,’ said
Seagrave, hoisting himself into the upper bunk.</p>

<p>‘Now, just watch me,’ grinned Boyd, pushing
back the table, ‘in my wonderful impersonation
of shut-eye Joe, the modern sleeping beauty.
Warranted to sleep until the next meal, or, failing
that, till Fritz shows us his world-famous tip-and-run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
stunt. Bye-bye, good people. Call me when
she swings.’</p>

<p>Raymond was taking the periscope watch himself,
as the others were fully employed on watch-keeping
and other duties when on the surface.
The morning dragged slowly away without incident,
and the land was getting distant now and was
barely visible by about eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>It was very still and peaceful once more, and the
two off-watch slept the sleep of the just. Occasionally
a man passed forward outside the curtains
on his way to the lockers, or the sound of voices
drifted in from the after compartment. Only the
sunlight, visible on the water through the periscope,
indicated that it was broad daylight.</p>

<p>Once an electric bell broke the stillness with a
persistent clanging which caused Boyd to leap
from his bunk and rush off muttering imprecations
on the gyro compass. The bell stopped, and
presently he reappeared.</p>

<p>Raymond looked an inquiry.</p>

<p>‘Only the Count,’ explained the other. ‘That
blessed twenty volt generator cut-out plays tricks
every now and again,’ and he relapsed into slumber
once more.</p>

<p>He was up again at eleven o’clock, however,
and telling Raymond that the sun would cross
the meridian at a quarter past.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>‘It’s no good,’ he groaned. ‘I’ve done my best
for you and you don’t get any better. I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
have to humour you or you may become dangerous.
However, I’ll see what can be done,’ and he went
to the periscope with the air of a doctor who knows
the case is hopeless.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he called from the control room.
‘We’ll rise for it. Too far off the land for bearings.
Wake Seagrave. Diving stations!’</p>

<p>Once more the men stood at their posts, and
the captain kept his eye at the periscope, while
Seagrave superintended and Boyd stood by with
his sextant ready.</p>

<p>‘Blow 2 and 3,’ came the order.</p>

<p>‘Open 2 and 3 Kingstons,’ cried Seagrave.</p>

<p>The levers were drawn back and there was a
faint jar and a rush of compressed air as Hoskins
opened the blows and the water was forced out
of the tanks.</p>

<p>The depth-needle came slowly back to four feet
and remained steady.</p>

<p>‘2 and 3 out, sir,’ said Hoskins.</p>

<p>The captain left the periscope and went up the
dark shaft of the conning-tower hatch. Very
gingerly he eased the strongback, and there was
a rush of escaping air as the pressure was released
from the boat.</p>

<p>Seagrave had his eye on the barometer, which
had swung round while diving to ‘off the map,’
and was now rapidly decreasing to the external
pressure.</p>

<p>‘One inch!’ he shouted up the hatch. ‘Equal!’</p>

<p>The men could feel the change in the atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
by a tickling sensation in the ears, much like having
a drop of water in them. Raymond threw open
the hatch and stepped out, followed by Boyd.</p>

<p>Up here the sunlight struck sharply on the
eyes. In this trim the boat was half submerged
and looked like some water-logged hulk wallowing
on the surface. She dripped at every pore, and
the calm sea washed sluggishly over her superstructure.</p>

<p>Three minutes later the sun crossed, and they
were down again, Raymond closing the hatch
behind him as he descended.</p>

<p>‘Flood main ballast,’ he ordered.</p>

<p>Once more the tanks filled, the Kingstons were
closed, and in less than sixty seconds she was
down to thirty feet again.</p>

<p>Ten minutes had sufficed for the whole business.</p>

<p>‘You’re getting a bit thick, Boyd,’ grumbled
the ‘Sub’ as they went back to the Ward Room.
‘I can’t get any sleep at all nowadays, what with
your confounded sights and the skipper’s blooming
energy. Last trip I was just caulking the bunk
good-oh when Raymond started a field-day of
pasting notices into the pilots. He said the paste
wouldn’t stick the things unless there was a weight
on them, and shoved the whole lot under me in
the bunk. I ought to get extra pay for that sort
of thing.’</p>

<p>‘Now, now, you mustn’t get in a state, dearie,’
replied Boyd. ‘Too much work is making you
peevish. Here’s lunch. Just try to pick a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
of chicken, cold one, and you’ll rise from the table
like a lion refreshed.’</p>

<p>‘At one time,’ said Raymond, sitting down,
‘we didn’t get much at sea, but in these new boats
I always look forward to the trip on account of the
change of grub.’</p>

<p>‘And yet we growl,’ put in Boyd. ‘I never met
any one at sea yet who hadn’t a moan about the
food.’</p>

<p>The meal was eaten in shirt sleeves, as the boat
was getting rather hot now that the sun was well
up, and after the fruit and custard had disappeared
Raymond leant back with a yawn.</p>

<p>‘Pity we can’t smoke,’ he said. ‘I’m feeling
damn tired. You keep a watch on the “perisher”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
this afternoon, Seagrave.’</p>

<p>‘All right. Turn in and trust me to let you
know if we bump a “mouldy.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> I won’t forget.’</p>

<p>In the after compartment the mess tables were
down and the men were getting outside their meal
seated on stools, the deck, or anything that came
to hand. The gyro buzzed on one side of them,
and the rattle of the steering-gear formed an
accompaniment, which, however, did not seem
to upset their appetites. Young men mostly,
with here and there a grizzled petty officer for
leavening, they moved about with that deftness
which men acquire who are accustomed to live in
confined spaces.</p>

<p>By-and-by, Seagrave went up the control room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
shaft and unscrewed one of the brass ports, disclosing
a small circle of thick glass. Through this
the water could be seen looking intensely blue,
while on glancing up he could see the surface
thirty feet above, which appeared like a blue
ceiling or a large sheet stretched over the boat.</p>

<p>Occasionally the under side of a piece of driftwood
could be seen floating on the surface and
the fore-deck, and the gun stood out sharply
defined.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was bad up here, as all the foul
air drifted upwards, and Seagrave soon screwed
back the post and returned to his book in the
fore compartment.</p>

<p>Every ten minutes came the monotonous order,
‘Eighteen feet,’ the periscope was hoisted and
lowered, and the boat descended to the thirty-foot
level.</p>

<p>Nearly every one was asleep, the heavy atmosphere
making them drowsy, and it was very quiet
and peaceful, when the second coxswain, who
was at the hydroplanes, called out <span class="locked">sharply,—</span></p>

<p>‘Getting ’eavy, sir! I can’t ’ol ’er up!’</p>

<p>Now, no submarine can descend to an unlimited
depth, because the external pressure becomes
too great, and below two hundred feet or so they
are liable to crush and flatten in like pancakes.
Also if she begins to leak owing to excessive depth,
water may get to the batteries, whereupon chlorine
gas will form and suffocate all hands. Therefore
a decent haste is necessary if at any time, owing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
to an increase of water in the bilges, the boat
becomes heavy and has what is known as ‘negative
buoyancy.’</p>

<p>Raymond and Seagrave hurried into the control
room, the captain giving his orders as he came.</p>

<p>‘Start the pump on the auxiliary. Speed up to
500 on the motors.’</p>

<p>The purr of the motors increased, and the
adjusting pump added its clack to the subdued
noises.</p>

<p>Raymond hoped that the extra speed by giving
her more steerage-weigh, and with the hydroplanes
‘hard-a-rise,’ would bring her up without the
tedious necessity of blowing main ballast.</p>

<p>She was going down fast, however. Forty,
fifty, sixty, seventy feet the depth-gauge recorded.
At seventy-five feet she stopped.</p>

<p>‘Stand by the hatches,’ cried Seagrave. ‘Report
any leak at once.’</p>

<p>She rose slowly and Raymond stopped the
pump. The coxswain twirled his wheel, and she
was bringing up at thirty feet when an avalanche
of water came down the conning-tower hatch.</p>

<p>The captain sprang for the ladder through the
mass of water and disappeared up the shaft. The
flow decreased and stopped, and he reappeared
drenched to the skin.</p>

<p>Everybody got very busy suddenly. Nobody
seemed to wish to be unduly noticed, and all
showed a strange eagerness for work of any sort.
The coxswain winked at the helmsman, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
worthy leant towards the compass with a fixed
stare.</p>

<p>‘These ruddy hatches!’ bellowed Raymond.
‘The damned thing came open, and I’ve only got
one shirt in the boat.’</p>

<p>‘Here, messenger,’ he added, pulling it off,
‘take this into the engine-room and get it dried.
No water in the battery, is there, Seagrave?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ replied the ‘Sub’ with a stony countenance.
‘That’s the best of these high coamings,
and we’ve got the rubber deck-cloth screwed well
down. The batteries are all right.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s a bit of luck, anyway. And now,
after that lot, another little drink wouldn’t do us
any harm. But don’t wake Boyd, as we haven’t
much whisky left.’</p>

<p>The pressure in the boat had slightly lifted the
hatch on the catch slipping its socket. Otherwise,
owing to the weight of thirty feet of water, it could
never have admitted the slightest drop.</p>

<p>‘All’s well that ends well,’ said Raymond, as
he raised his glass, ‘but that water coming in like
that certainly shook me. I didn’t think there was
so much pressure in the boat.’</p>

<p>‘It shook me far more to see you looking like
a drowned rat when you came down. This is
what is known ashore as “Seeing Life.”’</p>

<p>‘You keep a look-out with that “perisher,”
my boy, and don’t worry about me. You’ve got
a shirt to wear, and I haven’t, unless it’s dry before
we rise.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>Presently they relapsed into silence, and Raymond
dropped off to sleep again, while the ‘Sub’
carried on with the watch.</p>

<p>At four o’clock tea put in an appearance, after
which Boyd took his turn at the periscope watch,
while the others sat reading.</p>

<p>The wind had been increasing since noon, and
the sea was getting up. Looking through the
periscope his view was often obscured by the
waves, and occasionally they broke right over,
shutting out the scene as if a light blue curtain
had been flung over the eyes and torn away again.</p>

<p>Even at thirty feet the boat began to roll, and
when suddenly a bump was heard forward and a
rattle the whole length of the boat, Raymond
jumped from his chair, brought her quickly up
and glanced ahead.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to be seen, and he
lowered the periscope, the boat descending to the
patrol level again.</p>

<p>‘What was it?’ asked Seagrave.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. ‘Don’t know. One
of the mysteries of the deep. Perhaps a mine
that didn’t go off. Anyhow you can say so in
your letters home. I heard that noise three times
in an afternoon when I was in “85” last year.
You never can say for certain that it’s not the
moorings of a mine, so it’s always best to be on
the look-out if you hear that sort of row. I don’t
like them knocking to be let in in that way. It’s
too forward of them altogether.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>‘I saw that “U” boat we recovered the other
day when I was on leave,’ said Boyd. ‘She struck
a mine end on. Great Scott! she was a sight.
The whole bow-cap was blown right off, and they
found the bodies of the crew in her when they got
her up. Poor beggars. They’d grouped up
and put the hydroplanes hard-a-rise before they
were snuffed out.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ remarked Raymond. ‘I can’t say that
it gives me any particular pleasure to think of a
crowd of Germans in a submarine striking a mine.
It brings it too much home to one, as it were, and,
after all, they’re obeying orders in the same way
as we are.’</p>

<p>‘It must seem funny,’ said Seagrave. ‘One
minute sitting here reading, and the next, the
fore-end blown off and a wall of water flopping in
on you. I don’t expect you’d know much about
it, though.’</p>

<p>‘I say, you fellows,’ cried Boyd, coming in from
the control room. ‘There’s a hell of a sea getting
up. We’re in for a wet night. Sea-boots and oilskins
for mine.’</p>

<p>‘My usual luck,’ said Raymond, fishing in a
drawer. ‘I always get it rough on the way home.
Who’s the Jonah?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know. Some beggar who hasn’t paid
for his washing, I suppose. But we’re certainly
going to get it in the neck.’ The rolling of the
boat at this depth and the gurgling of the water
in the vent pipes was a sufficient warning of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
state of the weather, and they set to work lashing
all portable gear in place and preparing for the
expected wetting on coming to the surface.</p>

<p>‘We’d better have dinner before we rise, hadn’t
we?’ asked Boyd, struggling into a pair of oilskin
trousers. ‘Everything will be all over the shop,
and I’ve got some pretty good soup on hand
to-night. Main drain loungers and water.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Six-thirty will do,’ replied the captain,
‘and we’ll rise at seven. You might see about it,
Seagrave.’</p>

<p>The ‘Sub’ departed to the engine-room to confer
with his chief minion, and Raymond turned to
the navigator.</p>

<p>‘We’ll put her on the course for home now, I
think. We’re only about fifteen miles off Fritz’s
coast as it is, and we shan’t make much against
this.</p>

<p>‘All right. It’s just on half-past six now. I’ll
set the course and then shake dinner up.’</p>

<p>In the engine-room the E.R.A.’s were bustling
round the engines, and in the middle of dinner
the report came forward, ‘Engines ready, sir.’
The atmosphere was getting fuggy, and everything
seemed sticky, though there was no difficulty in
breathing yet.</p>

<p>‘We’re certainly in for it,’ said Raymond. ‘We
shan’t get home before daylight, and I shall let
her go slowly most of the time if it’s too bad. Now
then, ten to seven; shake it up with that cheese,
Boyd, and let’s get busy.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>A messenger appeared holding a bundle in his
hand, which he offered to the captain.</p>

<p>‘What the devil’s that thing?’ demanded Raymond.
‘Take it away. I don’t want your dish
swabs here.’</p>

<p>‘It’s your shirt, sir,’ replied the youth, without
a smile.</p>

<p>‘That nasty looking thing?’ replied the skipper,
seizing it and holding it at arm’s length. ‘Just
look at the straits I am reduced to. However,
it’s better than this prickly lammy coat I’ve been
wearing.’</p>

<p>‘Seven o’clock, sir,’ said Seagrave, looking at
his watch.</p>

<p>‘Right. Diving stations!’ ordered Raymond,
struggling into the garment as he hoisted the
periscope. ‘Blow 1, 2, and 3 main ballast. Pump
three thousand out of the auxiliary.’</p>

<p>‘Start the pump on the auxiliary. Open 1, 2,
and 3 Kingstons,’ shouted the ‘Sub.’</p>

<p>Up she came, the depth-needle hurrying back
to zero. She was in surface trim now, and, carefully
opening the hatch, Raymond, Boyd, and the helmsman,
clad in oilskins and sea-boots, clambered on
deck, the latter carrying the Sperry repeater.</p>

<p>‘One,’ shouted the captain down the hatch, as
a great spout of white water showed forward.
Then later, ‘two ... three. Upper deck control.
Open the vents!’</p>

<p>The tanks were out and the air was churning
up the sea outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>Hoskins shut off the blows, and at Seagrave’s
orders all vents and Kingstons were closed.</p>

<p>‘Engines!’ bellowed Raymond, ‘two fifty revs.’</p>

<p>With a fizz and a bang they were off, the smell
of the petrol on starting pervading the bridge in
spite of the strong wind.</p>

<p>It was a dirty night. Even a fair-sized vessel
would have felt it, and to ‘123’ the sea was dangerously
heavy.</p>

<p>The sun had just set, the sky was overcast, and
rain was beginning to fall. The north-westerly
wind was still increasing in force and raising a sea
that caught them just before the beam.</p>

<p>Night fell, bringing pitch darkness and torrents
of rain in its wake. The sea was quite steep now,
but the wind was steady. Great rollers came out
of the darkness, hit the submarine’s starboard
side, broke over her in a deluge of spray, and vanished
again to leeward.</p>

<p>The superstructure was hardly ever out of water,
and now and again a sea swept right over the
conning-tower, drenching to the skin the unfortunate
men who were hanging on for dear life.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock Raymond eased her down
to two hundred revs.</p>

<p>‘She’s not doing much,’ he said, turning to
Boyd; ‘not more than about four knots. Can’t
afford to smash things up. We’d better get right
home, and in this sea we shan’t be there before
daylight. Tell Seagrave to call me at four o’clock.
He’s got a charge on of five hundred in series, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
they’re getting the air up as well. He’ll see to that
in the middle watch, though.’</p>

<p>He went below, letting the conning-tower hatch
fall behind him, but not quite closing it (for the
greedy engines needed air to run on), and prepared
to lie down on his bunk.</p>

<p>Down below a sorry spectacle met his eyes.
The beam sea was causing the boat to roll very
heavily, and it was impossible to stand upright
without holding on to something. Not the roll of
a liner this, nor yet of a destroyer, but more the
motion of a quickly-moving pendulum. Right
over to port she would roll and then, without an
instant’s pause, as far over the other way, bringing
down a cloud of books and all sorts of gear that
had not been properly lashed up.</p>

<p>Whenever a big sea washed clean over her,
showers of spray would come down through the
small opening in the conning-tower hatch, and
once the chest of drawers took charge and slid
over on a man who was attempting to sleep on
deck.</p>

<p>Seagrave and Raymond were nearly rolled out
of their bunks, and the racing of the screws caused
an added vibration. Men in wet oilskins relieved
from the wheel came below dripping, and everything
began to get thoroughly damp and soggy.</p>

<p>At midnight Seagrave went up to the bridge.
On first clambering out of the hatch it seemed as
if he were entering a very inferno. Boyd, drenched
to the skin, turned over the watch to him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
hurried below, leaving him alone with the helmsman.</p>

<p>It was still pitch dark and blowing very hard.
The rain was pouring down, and she was shipping
it green fore and aft, but by-and-by he became
more accustomed to it and began to wait for the
big ones and dodge them instinctively; however,
it was rather a nerve-wracking night, and he hailed
with great joy the first glimpse of dawn and with
it a moderation of wind and sea.</p>

<p>When Raymond came up at four o’clock, the
weather was decreasing; the wind was still fresh,
but the sea had gone down, and the boat was running
more easily.</p>

<p>Seagrave wasted no time in getting below. He
inspected the batteries, took the densities, and
was between the blankets in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>As the light gained strength, Raymond could
just make out the faint outline of home, and the
sea moderated as they approached the shelter of
the bay to the northward.</p>

<p>He increased speed, and by seven-thirty they
were in smooth water and only ten miles off the
harbour.</p>

<p>Boyd clambered up to the bridge to assist
Raymond to take her in, while Seagrave buzzed
round the motors and saw all in readiness for
entering port.</p>

<p>Nearly all the crew who were not on watch were
up on deck; crowded on the conning-tower, round
the gun, anywhere where they could keep a safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
footing against the now gentle roll and get a breath
of fresh air after the trials and stuffy atmosphere
of the night below.</p>

<p>Up the hatch came the voice of the cheerful
stoker impressing on the signalman that ‘he didn’t
want to lose him, but he thought he ought to go,’
as the latter struggled up with his arms full of
flags, and, bending on a couple, hoisted them to
the yard-arm of the telescopic mast.</p>

<p>‘Entrance signal up, sir,’ he reported.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said Raymond. ‘What’s that on
the starboard bow?’</p>

<p>The signalman clapped his glass to his eye and
sucked his teeth.</p>

<p>‘British submarine, sir, approaching the harbour
from the northward. I think it’s “159,” sir.
She seems to be keeping level.’</p>

<p>Raymond jerked the bell.</p>

<p>‘Three fifty revs!’ he shouted down the hatch.
‘We’ll show her what we can do now. We’ll make
Snatcher look old-fashioned.’</p>

<p>The boat jumped ahead, but although the two
submarines were on courses converging to the
harbour mouth, she showed no signs of gaining
on the wily ‘159.’</p>

<p>Raymond frowned. Then he rang the bell again
and <span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>‘Ask the chief E.R.A. to speak to me, please.’</p>

<p>Presently Hoskins appeared, accompanied by
his eternal dirty face, cheerful grin, and lump of
oily waste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>‘Sir?’ he queried.</p>

<p>Raymond didn’t speak. He merely pointed to
the offending craft on the starboard beam.</p>

<p>A light of comprehension dawned on the artificer’s
face. His grin broadened and he fled below.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later ‘123’ shot through the
harbour-gate a good quarter of a mile ahead of her
adversary, and as she passed the piers the captain
gave the order ‘harbour stations.’</p>

<p>The coxswain took the helm. It was his prerogative,
and entering or leaving port none but
he was entrusted with the wheel.</p>

<p>The remainder of the crew who could be spared
from below fell in and stood at ease on the superstructure,
both forward and abaft the conning-tower,
under the orders of Seagrave.</p>

<p>As they passed the first of the big ships lying
at anchor, the ‘Sub’ gave a sharp order, and the
men came to attention facing towards her, and
as the quarter deck drew abeam, Raymond raised
his hand in a salute which was answered from the
battleship by the officer on the watch.</p>

<p>‘’Bout turn!’ ordered Seagrave, as they passed
the next ship, and once more salutes were exchanged.</p>

<p>By now ‘123’ was well up the bay, and the
<i>Parentis</i> was visible as the boat threaded her way
through the crowded harbour.</p>

<p>‘Finished harbour stations,’ ordered Raymond.
‘Stand by to go alongside.’</p>

<p>Then down the conning-tower <span class="locked">hatch,—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>‘Motors, group down! Three hundred!’</p>

<p>‘Both engine clutches out, sir,’ came the reply.
‘Three ’undred, sir.’</p>

<p>The exhaust wavered and died away; there
was a pause, and then the faint churning aft indicated
that the screws were being turned by the
electric motors, which were taking three hundred
amperes.</p>

<p>With perfect judgment Raymond manœuvred
her astern of the <i>Parentis</i>, and ‘123’ slid alongside
with barely a foot’s clearance.</p>

<p>As she slid <span class="locked">by,—</span></p>

<p>‘Stop both!’ rapped the captain. ‘Group up!
Astern both!’</p>

<p>The water bore aft as the propellers checked
her way. Heaving lines were thrown fore and
aft, ‘123’ thought about it, shuddered, and stopped
dead alongside.</p>

<p>‘Stop both. Finished with motors. Make fast
fore and aft,’ called Raymond. ‘Is the “Sperry”
stopped, Boyd?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. I stopped her when we got on the
bearing,’ replied the navigator.</p>

<p>‘Right-oh. Come on the pair of you. Time for
a gin and bitters.’</p>

<p>‘Clear up below, coxswain,’ cried Seagrave, as
the gang plank went out; and five minutes later
the three officers of H.M. Submarine ‘123’ were
in the <i>Parentis’s</i> ward room clamouring at the top
of their voices for gin, bitters, and baths.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">‘Chicago</span> high,’ announced the Fleet Surgeon of
the <i>Parentis</i>, throwing the dice on the ward room
table.</p>

<p>‘One hundred, two hundred, three hundred and
sixty-four,’ said the Staff Paymaster as he gathered
them up. ‘Not so dusty, P.M.O., but watch Little
Willie.’</p>

<p>‘Sixty, sixty-four, sixty-six, seventy-two,’ cried
the surgeon triumphantly. ‘The worst cut of modern
times. Waiter, Mr Ponsonby will provide cocktails.’</p>

<p>‘That shakes your wine bill, Pay,’ remarked
the Engineer Commander. ‘Six cocktails makes
you sit up and take notice. <em>And</em> don’t forget that
you’ve got to shake with old “Snatcher” when
“159” gets back. He’s absolutely undefeated,
a regular snatcher of drinks at other people’s
expense.’</p>

<p>‘You’re probably speaking from bitter experience,
Chief,’ asked Blake, one of the submarine
captains.</p>

<p>‘I am,’ replied the Engineer, shaking his head.
‘Last time I took him on I got six at “Chicago
low,” and he lurked me with a possible. I used
to think I was a pretty fair hand at cutting, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
I admit that where “159” is concerned I’ve met
my Waterloo.’</p>

<p>‘By Jove, yes. She ought to be in by now,
unless she’s had bad weather, which isn’t likely.
You can usually trust “Snatcher” to sit on the
bottom if it comes on to blow. But he ought to
be back shortly. I always work it so as to get
back in time for a bath before dinner when I’m on
the patrol he’s got now.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, P.M.O.,’ protested a voice from the
other end of the ward room. ‘These people are
ordering more gin. In the interests of public health
and the Service I appeal to you, as a medical man,
to tell them not to, to put your foot down; in a
word, to stop it. They’re going to start the gramaphone
and it’s only half-past six, and I can’t stand
it.’</p>

<p>‘It looks to me like an advanced case of alcoholic
neuritis,’ replied the surgeon gravely, ‘for
which the only remedy is a prolonged course of
ragtime on the gramaphone at eight a.m. It had
better work itself out, that is, unless they include
me in their disgusting gin debauch, in which case
I don’t mind prescribing something a little less
drastic.’</p>

<p>It was the hour before dinner, when every one
congregates for a drink before going below to clean
and change, and the <i>Parentis’s</i> ward room was
crowded. It was large as ward rooms go, and
furnished in the usual Service style, with maroon
leather chairs and sofas, a long table covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
with the green Service cloth, and cases of Encyclopædias
and works on Naval history. The walls
were adorned with photographs of the various
submarines which had been attached to the ship
at different times, and formed quite an interesting
feature in themselves.</p>

<p>At present the <i>Parentis</i> was depot ship to a
large number of boats, and as each boat had three
officers, the Marine servants were usually kept
pretty busy at cocktail time.</p>

<p>Youngish men mostly, the submarine captains
would meet at this hour of the day and discuss
‘shop’ to an extent that maddened the more junior
members of the mess. Little scraps of conversation
they were, but not without meaning to the uninitiated,
and based on the experience of men who
sometimes carried their lives in their hands.
Periscopes, stern-dives, and the latest class of
boat were discussed, coloured with the charm of
personal experiences and scraps of idle chaff.</p>

<p>‘The ‘Subs’ of the boats were either junior
Lieutenants or senior Sub-Lieutenants. Earnest,
talkative youths, very much alive to the responsibilities
of their positions, and the burdens attaching
thereto, who ordered their drinks with the abandon
of those who have done a hard day’s work and
‘dare do all that may become a man.’</p>

<p>The remainder of the mess was composed of the
depot officers: paymaster, surgeon, engineer, and
watch-keepers, and the navigators of the submarines.
These latter were all Lieutenants of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the Royal Naval Reserve, whose ages ranged
anywhere from twenty-three to forty; men from
the great steamship lines of the Mercantile Marine,
who had answered the country’s call at the outbreak
of the war.</p>

<p>There was a general buzz of conversation over
the room as friends discussed the events of the
day and compared notes, before undertaking the
more serious business of dinner.</p>

<p>‘I say, you fellows,’ exclaimed Seagrave to a
group of brother ‘Subs,’ ‘“159” went to sea
without any gin. “Bunty” tried to pull the
strings twice, but the mess-man wasn’t having
any.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ chimed in another. ‘I went down the
boat before she shoved off to try and get a drink
out of him, but when I got there the cupboard
was bare.’</p>

<p>‘By the way, aren’t they back yet?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t think so. You’d hear ’em quick enough
if they were. They do seem to be a bit late.
Probably strafed a Hun.’</p>

<p>‘If they’d done that they’d be back at the double.
They hadn’t anything to celebrate it with.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t help their troubles, and if we don’t want
to be late for dinner we’d better get moving,’ and,
snatching his cap from a pile on the table, the
speaker linked arms with a couple of cronies
and waltzed out of the room.</p>

<p>‘My opinion,’ said the Torpedo Lieutenant to
a circle of boat captains gathered round the fireplace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
‘is that you fellows take life too seriously.
Look at me. I work all day. I’m a fine figure of
a man.... Now, then, no rude remarks, please.
And I come in here in the evening as merry as a
cricket.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all right,’ replied one of his listeners.
‘It all depends on one’s definition of the word
work. You ought to look it up; you’d find it
instructive.’</p>

<p>‘Your pardon, sir. My labours are long and
strenuous. I went down three boats to-day and
gave my valuable advice on Mark XX torpedoes.
But alas! this is a thankless world. I received
recompense in only two. The other boat had
lost her corkscrew.’</p>

<p>‘Say, Boyd,’ cried a voice at the other end of
the room, ‘how did the gyro behave last trip?’</p>

<p>‘A 1. I’m becoming a perfect knut at it. He
only rang once. I’ve come to the conclusion that
when you know the elements of its construction,
it’s as easy as falling off a log. Yes, a cocktail,
please, waiter. I had some trouble at first though,
but that was my own fault. In fact I composed
a song entitled “When the Sperry bell is ringing.”’</p>

<p>‘Mine’s jolly fine now, never makes a murmur.’</p>

<p>‘When you’re quite finished your harangue on
work, a subject on which you are grossly ignorant,
Torps, perhaps you will pay a little attention to
me.’ The voice was Raymond’s.</p>

<p>‘Now, tell me why. Why am I to listen to your
fatuous and narrow-minded remarks on a topic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
that is not only entirely distasteful to me at all
times, but altogether beyond the pale at this hour
of the evening.’</p>

<p>‘My fatuous remark, as you are pleased to call
it, was about to take the form of asking you to
have a gin with me, but seeing <span class="locked">that——’</span></p>

<p>‘Kamerad, kamerad. I apologise—for once you
talk as a Christian should. Friends, Romans,
countrymen, lend him your ears. He’s going to
do the decent. I can feel it coming on.’</p>

<p>‘At one time, in my palmy days, when I was
your age,’ said Raymond, raising his glass, ‘I could
go a whole pint of beer without swallowing. But
now—— It’s a bit ’ard. Cheer-oh, everybody.’</p>

<p>In the train of the drinks came the Marine
servants bearing the table-cloths and silver, and
a general move was made for the door.</p>

<p>‘This,’ said the Torpedo Lieutenant as he foraged
for his cap, ‘is what I joined the Navy for. To
dine and meditate with friends.... Damn it,
Pay, you’ve pinched my bonnet.’</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Private Boon, R.M.L.I., knocked at his master’s
door.</p>

<p>‘Mr Blake, sir. ’Alf-past seven. Your bath’s
ready, sir.’</p>

<p>The sleeper awoke, yawned, and threw one
pyjama-clad leg over the bunk board.</p>

<p>‘All right. I’ll be out in a minute,’ he grunted.</p>

<p>The private withdrew and Blake turned over
and looked at his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>‘Um,’ he groaned. ‘Better hurry up, I suppose,
or some one will pinch my bath.’</p>

<p>As he slipped on a dressing-gown, a photograph
on the table caught his eye.</p>

<p>‘Wonder if “159” has got back yet,’ he mused,
as he made his way down the corridor. ‘Ought
to be in by now,’ and he disappeared into the
bathroom, where sounds of splashing and ‘Miserere’
in a deep bass shortly issued.</p>

<p>On his return he found the private of Marines
busy in his room.</p>

<p>‘Is “159” back yet, Boon?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Not yet, sir. I’ve got Mr Shelldon’s room ready
for ’im. But they ain’t back yet, sir.’</p>

<p>A vague uneasiness crept over Blake. What
was ‘Snatcher’ doing that he was twelve hours
overdue?</p>

<p>‘Oh, rubbish,’ he told himself as he began dressing,
‘I expect he’s been delayed some way or other.
Engines broken down or something.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, boiled eggs in ten minutes’ time, Boon,
not too hard, please.’</p>

<p>Breakfast in the <i>Parentis</i> was not what would
be called a cheery meal. Conversation was not
encouraged, and hilarity of any sort met with
frowning disapproval. The sober-minded read
newspapers, while their less literary brethren kept
their mouths shut except for the necessity of
admitting food.</p>

<p>When the more senior members of the mess
had got to the first pipe stage, the ‘Subs’ departed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
to muster their crews, and the navigators drifted
off to odd jobs. The captains of boats congregated
round the fireplace and discussed plans for the
day, while the doctor censored letters and the Staff
Paymaster busied himself with the wine books.
Gradually the groups broke up and the Marines
began tidying the room for the morning.</p>

<p>In the early hours—at six o’clock to be exact—the
ship’s company had been fallen in by the officer
of the watch, and under the eagle eye of the First
Lieutenant had scrubbed the decks and cleaned
the brass till the <i>Parentis</i> shone like a new pin.
Alongside her, four on one side and five on the
other, were her charges, the submarines, at present
in a state of ordered chaos due to work of an
extensive and all embracing character.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the crew, mustered in their
boats by their respective ‘Subs,’ were told off for
the labours of the day, and by five minutes past
were all hard at it. The E.R.A.’s were busying
themselves in their engine-rooms and the electrical
ratings on various jobs that came within their
sphere, while the remainder were cleaning all
brass and steelwork and were kept at it by the
vigilant ‘Subs.’</p>

<p>Navigators were correcting charts and cleaning
gyro compasses, and now and again the captains
would dodge below to superintend, or two or three
of them would hang round a periscope or a torpedo-tube
arguing a knotty point or demonstrating
the correctness of their theories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>It was a fine warm day, and the <i>Parentis</i> looked
like a hen in a gilded coop with her chicks clustered
about her. All round her lay the Fleet; picket
boats danced across from ship to ship, the sound
of a Marine band drifted over from a neighbouring
battleship, and the buzz of work rose on the air.</p>

<p>The officer of the watch, resplendent with a
sword-belt and telescope, walked the quarter-deck,
keeping a general eye on everything that
took place. The quartermaster, corporal of the
watch, and messengers hung round the gangway,
and even the distant bridge was a scene of activity,
where a gray-haired yeoman of signals harried his
signal staff round the gaudy flag lockers.</p>

<p>Forward an R.N.R. Lieutenant was drilling the
boys’ division at physical exercise, and down
below the submarine attack ‘teacher’ was being
kept busily employed.</p>

<p>A picket-boat approached the gangway. The
midshipman who was steering held up four fingers
and laid them on his coat-sleeve, and as she swung
alongside the gangway party formed up. A tall,
erect figure stepped out of the boat, the bos’n’s
mate shrilled on his pipe, the quarter-deck came
to attention, and the officer of the watch saluted.
A Post Captain had come aboard.</p>

<p>The boys’ division fell out and gave place to a
squad under torpedo instruction; the Marine
detachment paraded, and then the bugle sounded
‘Stand easy.’</p>

<p>Men came up out of the boats to snatch a smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
during the ten minutes’ respite; or laid aside their
brass rags and departed to the mess decks. Ten
minutes blessed relief before ‘Carry on’ sounded
by the diminutive Marine bugler sent them back
to their tasks.</p>

<p>Later, the Captain of the depot held his court
for defaulters. Then ‘cooks’ was sounded, the
rum was served out, and at eight bells, noon, came
the welcome dinner call.</p>

<p>Up over the side came the crews, followed in a
more dignified manner by the officers, who dived
below to their rooms, to wash and don a clean
monkey-jacket for lunch.</p>

<p>Blake came up out of his boat, fully expecting
to see ‘159’ in her accustomed berth, and it was
with quite a shock that he realised that she had
not yet returned. It was with a presentiment of
something seriously amiss that he presently took
his seat at the luncheon-table.</p>

<p>The same feeling seemed to express itself in the
others’ faces, but this might be only his imagination.
No one spoke of ‘159,’ in fact they all seemed to
leave her severely alone. But there was a general
feeling in the air that all was not well, and it seemed
evident, though no word was actually spoken, that
everybody fully realised the fact that she was now
sixteen hours late, and a boat that is sixteen hours
overdue in war-time ... well, things <em>may</em> have
happened.</p>

<p>Once he made a casual remark to his neighbour
on the matter. His answer was merely a nod<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
between mouthfuls, so he dropped the subject
and said no more about it.</p>

<p>But for all that, he was becoming convinced
that something had taken place ... out there.
‘Snatcher’ Shelldon and he had been friends since
their <i>Britannia</i> days. His surroundings looked
unfamiliar and a sickening anxiety came over
him. ‘How could the others go on eating when
perhaps?...’</p>

<p>He pulled himself together and made a pretence
at a meal. ‘Mustn’t give way to morbid imaginings,’
he told himself.</p>

<p>The meal over he sat apart and tried to collect
his thoughts and enumerate various minor mishaps
that might have delayed the boat. No, he could
think of none that would account for it under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>At one-thirty work was resumed, and he plunged
into a fever of exertion to take his thoughts off
the subject. He made up his mind he wouldn’t
come on deck before four o’clock, when work
ceased for the day, and then either the sight of
‘159’ would dispel all doubts or else he had no more
to hope for.</p>

<p>But at four o’clock, when the hands were piped
to tea, there was still no news, and shortly after
‘evening quarters’ two destroyers slipped quietly
out of the harbour. Those who noticed their
departure thought nothing of it at the time, and
only wondered why the Captain’s temper seemed
the worse for wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>By dinner time it was evident that every one
in the mess was awake to the fact that a boat was
missing, and in fine weather, too. Nobody mentioned
her; they all kept studiously off the subject, but
the conversation was subdued and everybody’s
nerves seemed slightly on edge. Many of them
had friends among the absent officers, and no one
liked to voice the general opinion, although it
would have been a relief if some one had.</p>

<p>It was not a cheery meal, and they were all glad
when it was over.</p>

<p>Thus it was left to Private Boon to rush in where
angels feared to tread.</p>

<p>‘That’s three of ’em less to lay for,’ he said.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Two days later the captain of the depot sat
alone in his after-cabin.</p>

<p>He was bending over the writing-table, surrounded
by envelopes, paper, and accessories, but
his thoughts did not seem to flow. He sat staring
in front of him with unseeing eyes and chewing
the end of his pen.</p>

<p>At last he sighed and addressed himself to his
task. Three letters he was writing, to anxious
women who were waiting and hoping beyond hope,
two wives and a lonely mother, to tell them that
they might hope no longer. This kindly old gentleman
was compiling the missives which were to
bring anguish and sorrow to the hearts of those
who waited.</p>

<p>They were more than junior officers to him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
One was the son of an old comrade and the others
had served long under his command. To them
he had been, no doubt, rather a terrifying person
with four gold stripes on his sleeve, but to him,
they were his boys; he had been through it all
himself, he was training them, and he was proud
of them. Above all came the Service, and he had
trained them for the good of the Service. A kindly
word now and again and a sharp reprimand when
needed had been the secret of his successes, and
beneath his gruff exterior he had a warm feeling
towards them. Now he had lost them and his
work was to do over again.</p>

<p>His hand was about to bring grief unspeakable
to their dearest and....</p>

<p>He finished his letters; the few kindly, sympathetic
words that were to be almost death-blows
on the morrow, and as he raised his head from the
table and glanced into the mirror he saw the face
of a tired old man.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Blake picked up the photograph and held it
close to the electric light. As he studied the honest
face it depicted, his memory flew back to the
<i>Britannia</i> days when Shelldon and he had started
their careers. They had been the same term and
had gone through all their early trials and tribulations
together. Later, ‘Snatcher’ had spent one
or two holidays with him, and years afterwards
the friendship had been cemented by his engagement
to Blake’s sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>He remembered the wedding, and how as best
man he had put in one of the hardest day’s work
in his life. He smiled as he recalled his friend’s
delight when first he had been promoted to captain
of a boat, and he put down the photograph and
sighed.</p>

<p>‘It seemed so cold-blooded. To go out and just
disappear. No trace, nothing. Blown to pieces
on a mine probably. He could picture the scene.
The men quietly reading and talking and then
suddenly a blinding crash and nothing more. If
some one could only have seen them. But the
two destroyers that went in search had only found
a patch of oil. Just went out and disappeared.
And Molly....’</p>

<p>A knock sounded at the door.</p>

<p>‘Come in,’ he called, hastily stowing the photograph
away.</p>

<p>Raymond entered with an air of studied indifference.</p>

<p>‘Hope you’re not busy, old man,’ he said with
forced gaiety.</p>

<p>‘No, no. I’m not doing anything. Come in.’</p>

<p>‘Good. I wanted to know if you would lend
me your T.I. to-morrow. Mine’s gone sick and
I’ve got a job of work on hand I want finished.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, of course, you can. Take him and bless
you. I’ll send a chit to my “Sub” about it.’</p>

<p>Raymond hovered with the door-knob in his
hand, opened his mouth to speak, thought better
of it, and left quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>Out in the flat, he faced his friend’s cabin, and
raising his fists in the air, called Heaven to
witness.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Bloody War!’ he exclaimed.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>‘As a general rule, mind you, I don’t ’old with
officers, but ’e was a gentleman.’</p>

<p>The speaker spat over the side to emphasise
his point, and relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>The lower deck sat round in small knots and
coteries and smoked for the most part without
unnecessary speech. The pipes were going, the
evening was dark and still, and the lower deck
was in a contemplative mood.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ continued the Seaman Gunner, ‘’im and
’is mates was gentlemen.’</p>

<p>‘Pal o’ mine, Mick ’Ardy, was in ’er,’ quoth the
S.T. ‘Fust trip in a submarine, too. Out fer
trainin’. ’Ard I calls it.’</p>

<p>‘Strewth,’ said a voice out of the darkness, ‘we
was on ’er patrol last trip. Bit o’ luck we didn’t
come a kisser.’</p>

<p>‘It was that,’ put in the signalman. ‘We’re
doo out to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Once more silence. Three bells struck and a
bugle sounded from a distant battleship.</p>

<p>‘I’d like to know wot ’appened,’ said the voice
out of the darkness. ‘Struck a mine likely. When
I come into submarines, my old woman she sez
to <span class="locked">me——’</span></p>

<p>‘Stow it,’ growled the Seaman Gunner. ‘Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the other day, ’e sez, “’Bout time,” ’e sez, “you
went up for Leading Seaman. I want to see you
gettin’ a ’ead. I’ll ’elp you through,” ’e sez.’</p>

<p>‘Wot I think,’ said the Stoker, ‘is, strike me
pink. If I don’t pulverise the first ruddy ’Un I
meets, Gawd strike me pink.’</p>

<p>‘Pipe down,’ shrilled the bos’n’s mate.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Private Boon was busy. He stood in his shirt-sleeves
in the midst of a chaos of his own
making.</p>

<p>Outside the cabin was a sea-chest of generous
proportions, and in the bunk he had placed a tin
uniform case, a helmet case, and divers bags and
portmanteaux.</p>

<p>He was a careful packer, but his methods were
unique. He liked to see things round him, and
after the manner of an inquisitive terrier, he began
to strip the drawers of their contents and strew
garments high and low. The table, the chairs,
and the bunk was soon piled high, and when the
last drawer gaped void and empty he surveyed
his handiwork with the eye of a connoisseur.</p>

<p>But he showed himself a past master of the art
when he began packing the uniforms in the tin
case. Every article was carefully shaken, brushed
and folded, and reverently placed in its appointed
spot. This portion of his labours completed, he
dealt with the sea-chest, and by that time the
collection round the cabin had materially decreased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Having finished the clothes at last, he turned
to the more personal objects, scrutinising each
one before finally disposing of it.</p>

<p>‘Ash tray, silver too,’ he soliloquised. ‘Give
’im by a girl likely. ’Air brushes, monogram an’
all. Nice bit o’ work. Books, letters, fountain
pen. I think that’s the lot.’</p>

<p>His eye caught a small silver frame standing
on the table forlorn and forgotten.</p>

<p>‘’Ullo, photograph.’ He held it to the light.
‘Nice-looking young woman, <em>and</em> a kid. Might
be ’is Missis. P’raps it is, poor gell!’</p>

<p>He locked the cases and looked round the
cabin.</p>

<p>‘Nothin’ forgot. No. I think that’s all this
time.’</p>

<p>With much laboured breathing he wrote the
owner’s name and address, and, carefully tacking
the card on the lid of the sea-chest, stood back
to admire the result.</p>

<p>‘Effects of the Late Lieutenant Shelldon,
<span class="locked">R.N.——’</span></p>

<p>Through the open port the sound of an order
floated, and the churning of twin screws. It was
‘147’ going to sea.</p>

<p>A Sub-Lieutenant and a Midshipman stood on
the quarter-deck of a neighbouring battleship.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Said the ‘Sub,’ aged twenty, to the ‘Snotty,’
aged nineteen, ‘I bearded the Commander in his
den to-day, and flopped in my application.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>‘Did you? What did he say?’ inquired the
Midshipman.</p>

<p>‘Look out, he’s over there. Said it was all right
and he’d see the Captain about it to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘You lucky beggar. I wish I could get in, but
they won’t take us “Snotties.”’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you’ll get in when you’re my age,’
returned the bearder of Commanders patronisingly.</p>

<p>‘By gum, yes. I hope so. I’ve always wanted
to be in a submarine, ever since the Marmora
business.’ He gazed across at the <i>Parentis</i>. ‘Look,
there’s one of them going to sea. Can you see
which she is?’</p>

<p>The ‘Sub’ shaded his eyes.</p>

<p>‘“147,” I think. Billings is in her. He’s my
term, and he got in without much trouble. I
ought to get it in two months or so with any
luck.’</p>

<p>‘That’ll mean drinks all round then, that’s one
comfort,’ said the Midshipman enviously.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I shan’t mind standing drinks once I’ve
got it. Man, you’re practically your own boss
there. Think of it, no school or bally drills. You’re
not treated as a child like you are here.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know about that. That picket-boat
job I had yesterday wasn’t much of a joke.’</p>

<p>A signalman came through the screen door and
approached the Commander, who was conferring
with the Boatswain on the other side of the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>‘Signal, sir,’ he reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>The Commander looked round impatiently.</p>

<p>‘Well, what is it? Read it out.’</p>

<p>‘Flag, General, sir. From two to three p.m.
Colours will be ’alf mast owing to the loss of
Submarine “159.”’</p>

<p>‘All right. Show it to the Officer of the Watch.
Now, about that new manilla, Mr Bostock....’</p>

<p>The signalman saluted and carried on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_69">‘EXERCISE ATTACKS’</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> has already been pointed out that breakfast
in the <i>Parentis</i> was a meal of Spartan severity.
Moreover, the breakfasters were divided into three
distinct classes. During the remainder of the day
the members of these different orders descended
to the level of the common herd and were as other
men. But when the fateful hour of eight a.m.
came round again, they picked up the broken
threads of their lives, and for one brief hour held
chillily aloof from those of other and (according
to the point of view) less distinguished bodies.</p>

<p>The most elevated of these orders consisted of
those few habitually early risers, who, having
shaved and bathed at the grisly hour of 7.15,
loomed heavily into the ward room with severe
countenances and majestic mien, each a procession
in himself. In sepulchral tones they ordered
eggs, and taking up a strategic position with their
backs to the fire, produced books from their pockets
and read in heavy silence, with one eye cocked
doorwards whence breakfast would appear.</p>

<p>On the arrival of food they took their seats in
awful majesty, nodded to one another across the
table, and attacked their eggs without further
preamble. The actions of the noble-minded of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
this earth are often mysteries to its more humble
inhabitants. But <i lang="la">Conscia mens recti</i> may do these
things and prosper.</p>

<p>To arrest public attention, man must be eccentric,
but even greatness has its penalties, and of these
the discomfort attendant on eccentricity is by no
means one of the least.</p>

<p>Consequently the second, and by far the most
numerous, school of breakfasters, comprised the
‘plebs’ or rabble, who drifted in at any time between
eight-twenty and a quarter to nine, having risen
and dressed with decorum, and at the hour when
a normal Christian should.</p>

<p>Its adherents held a brighter view of life;
occasionally they spoke, and rumour whispered
that once in the dim ages, far back in the twilight
of history, a member of this low caste has even
been known to laugh!</p>

<p>The third and last clan, which was very popular
with certain members of the mess, rivalled in fame
its more ascetic brethren who aspired to be ‘healthy,
wealthy, and wise.’ Its devotees, having remained
in bed until the last minute, fled in terror to the
bathroom, visions of pyjamas and flying towels,
and presently burst wild-eyed into the mess, still
buttoning their monkey jackets about them. In
panic-stricken tones they ordered food and (if the
table had not already been cleared) fell upon the
viands in the manner of drowning men to whom
help had come when hope had been foregone.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the forenoon the ward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
room would be filled with the bitter complaints
of the less fortunate of these late-comers. Complaints
to the effect that ‘they never could get
any breakfast in this wretched ship,’ and of the
futility and feebleness of the calls given them by
their respective Marine servants.</p>

<p>A new member coming to the mess grasped the
situation at his first meal, and felt it a point of
unwritten law and honour to continue membership
in whichever body chance had happened to
place him. He resented those who altered their
morning habits and broke through the magic
circle, and showed his displeasure by word or
look, according to the traditions of the body to
which he belonged.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Raymond, who was a member
of the ‘plebs,’ having risen unusually early, was
met with severe and threatening looks as he took
his seat at the table. The fluttering in the dove-cotes
was barely stilled when, horror, another
intruder arrived on the scene of mastication. As
if this were not sufficient outrage in itself, the
breakers of the peace seemed in good humour
with the world and actually dared to talk! With
frigid looks the early risers hastily finished their
meal and retired with ruffled dignity.</p>

<p>One only remained whose curiosity had got the
better of his wounded feelings. For a while he
listened to what the others were saying in the
hopes of obtaining a clue to the mystery without
having to resort to the self-abasement of asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
questions, but as nothing was spoken of that would
help him in that direction he was forced to swallow
his pride. Presently he looked up from the book
he was pretending to read and grunted with disgust.</p>

<p>‘Up early,’ he began, nodding at Raymond.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ replied that worthy brightly. ‘Practice
attacks.’</p>

<p>The curious one sat up and took professional
notice.</p>

<p>‘One of the world’s workers this morning, eh?
Who’s giving you a run?’</p>

<p>‘Jenkins, here. His T.B.’s alongside now, so
I asked him to come aboard and have a drop of
breakfast with me.’</p>

<p>‘Now I come to think of it, I heard Jinks’s falsetto
when I was in my bath. He made rather a mess
of coming alongside, I thought, and I suppose he
was mentioning it to any one who cared to listen
to him.’</p>

<p>‘Made a mess of it, be blowed!’ cried the irate
Jenkins. ‘You try a combination of tide, and a
fool at the wheel at seven in the morning, and then
you’ll realise what I’ve had to put up with.’</p>

<p>‘I have, my lad, I have. My heart went out
to you when I heard the bump. There ought to
be an addition made to the lists of “summary
punishments,” entitling outraged “Lieutenants-in-command”
to seize all helm offenders and cast
them instantly into chains.’</p>

<p>‘Blame the Kaiser, he’s the cause of the trouble,’
returned the Torpedo Boat captain sadly. ‘I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
well stocked with “hostility only” people, who
never smelt salt water before they sold their farms
and came to sea. You wouldn’t believe some of
the weird stories I could tell you. Did you ever
hear about my gray paint?’</p>

<p>‘I heard some of the most extraordinary rumours.
What actually happened?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it was chronic. Burton, my Number One,
was nearly a raving lunatic over it, and hasn’t
been the same man since. It quite broke the
poor chap down. He’d been trying to mix the
right shade for days, and thought he really had hit
on it at last. It was all mixed in a whopping great
tub ready for slapping on in the morning, and the
whole bally lot disappeared during the night.’</p>

<p>‘Great Scott! What the devil happened to it?’</p>

<p>‘Prepare for a shock and I’ll break it to you
gently. It had been dumped, jettisoned, thrown
over the side, mark you, by an “’ostility only”
bloke wot thort it was dirty water, sir, please!’</p>

<p>‘My poor old Jinks. No wonder he wears a
careworn look.’</p>

<p>‘All very well for you to laugh, Austin, but it’s
these little things that are the bane of one’s existence
in the destroyer trade. Upsets of this sort and
submarines are about on a par with one another.’</p>

<p>‘We ought to be ready by now,’ said Raymond,
rising and going over to the scuttle. ‘Seagrave
has been up since dewy dawn getting ready. Yes,’
he continued, looking over his shoulder, ‘he seems
to be having a high old time of it by himself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
by the looks of things we’re all ready when you
are.’</p>

<p>‘Right-oh. I shove off at eight-thirty, don’t I?’</p>

<p>‘I haven’t had a “dummy run” for ages,’
grumbled Austin. ‘The owner thinks I’m so
proficient I don’t need any more, I expect.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, my friend,’ laughed Raymond. ‘You’re
not his blue-eyed boy by a long chalk. It’s common
knowledge that you made such a fiasco of your
last one that he doesn’t like to trust you again.’</p>

<p>‘Maybe, maybe,’ replied Austin amiably. (He
was one of the best submarine officers in the
depot.) ‘Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings....
What’s the stunt to-day, anyway?’</p>

<p>‘Just the usual. Jinks goes out at eight-thirty
and buzzes about in a ten mile area. I follow when
I’ve digested my food, dive when he least expects
it, and attack him in his little sardine tin by short
sharp rushes. I shall then be crowned with laurel
leaves, which, with my accustomed modesty, I shall
refuse to wear.’</p>

<p>‘That’s open to question. Last time Jinks gave
me a run I couldn’t get anywhere near him. How
many “fish” are you going to fire?’</p>

<p>‘Probably four, I think. It depends whether
it’s worth while. You see, I’ve got that patent
bow-cap, and as I have to flood all four tubes
together, I might as well get rid of the “fish.”’</p>

<p>‘That always seems to me to be a rummy arrangement.
Personally I can’t see much advantage in
it. Do you find it any good?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>‘It’s handy in one way. If you miss with your
first shot, your other tubes are ready for another go.’</p>

<p>‘My dear good chap, you must not be such a
Hun. You’ll have to curb these desires for hate.
Why should you want to rain “fish” on unfortunate
beggars in that way?’</p>

<p>‘Time’s up,’ said the Torpedo Boat captain,
pushing his chair back. ‘I’ll get off now. What’s
the betting I spot you?’</p>

<p>‘Cocktails when we get back,’ Raymond called
after him.</p>

<p>‘I’ll take you,’ said Jenkins, putting his head
in through the ward room door. ‘I’ve got a
wonderful eye for spotting periscopes.’</p>

<p>‘Mine is the “perisher” you will <em>not</em> spot,’ replied
Raymond with dignity. ‘Not if you try ever
so. Not if you try with both hands, you won’t.’</p>

<p>‘The youth bores me,’ sighed Jenkins, and fled
as the <i>Naval Annual</i> banged up against the bulkhead.</p>

<p>He made his way down the flat, where the Marine
sentry stood at stolid attention, and glimpses
could be had, through open doors, of those who
wrestled manfully with collars, and the air was
rent with shrill cries and splashings from the bathroom.
Messengers and officers’ servants were
bustling about, and there was a general air of early
morning energy. At the end of the flat, he stepped
up the companion and emerged on the quarter-deck,
where he gravely raised his hand to the
salute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>‘Hallo, Jinks!’ cried a being, whose sword-belt
and telescope proclaimed him the Officer of the
Watch; ‘I was surprised to find your packet
alongside when I took over at eight o’clock. What’s
the game?’</p>

<p>‘I’m giving Raymond a run, and as I’m short
of torpedo-lifting gear, I got permission to come
alongside and take some in before shoving out of
the harbour.’</p>

<p>‘I see. What time are you shoving off though,
because “147” will be back in half an hour’s time
and she’ll want your berth alongside the trot<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you worry. I’m off now. If you’d taken
careful stock of me you’d have seen the business-like
look in my eye.’</p>

<p>‘That’ll be all right then. Good luck. When
are you coming aboard to dine with us, by the
way?’</p>

<p>‘Any old time when I’m free will suit me.’</p>

<p>‘Well, come to-night, then. Dinner’s at seven-thirty.
Cheer-oh.’</p>

<p>H.M. Torpedo Boat <i>Zero</i> lay alongside the outer
submarine, and Jenkins had to clamber over the
boats to reach his command. Four boats there
were, with just a thin plank thrown from one to
the other as a means of passage, and it required
a little skilful manœuvring to get across in safety.
As he made his way over he caught glimpses of
their internals down the open hatches, heads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
bobbed round the conning-towers, and snatches
of song rose from the depths. Some of the crew
of the outer boat were exchanging insults with
the <i>Zero’s</i> men alongside, but at sight of Jenkins
they resumed their work with unaccustomed zeal.</p>

<p>The <i>Zero</i> was old, very old, and quite unlovely,
but according to her captain, ‘she had her points.’
What these points were no one had ever discovered,
for all inquiries were met with the reply that ‘if
they couldn’t see them for themselves, he (the captain)
was certainly not going to the trouble of pointing
them out for their (the inquirer’s) instruction.’
She was small and uncomfortable and resembled
an overgrown motor-launch with a whale-back
fo’c’sle. Also she was wet in a sea way, and her
internal arrangements were not of the most convenient.
Nevertheless she was a command, and
in her captain’s eye she had no blemish. Later,
when he had four stripes on his sleeve, and commanded
a battleship, he would look back on her
and study her photographs with amusement and
a little sorrow, but now, he was very serious about
her and very touchy about criticisms. No man
dared speak lightly of her since the awful day
when ‘Snatcher’ Shelldon had referred to her as
‘a lady of doubtful age.’ The result had been
terrific, and from that day nobody had openly
questioned the <i>Zero</i> or her capabilities.</p>

<p>As he stepped aboard, Burton, the R.N.R. First
Lieutenant, met him and saluted.</p>

<p>‘All ready, sir,’ he reported.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>‘Very good, we’ll shove off at once,’ said Jenkins.
‘“123” will follow us in half an hour, so we haven’t
got too much time. Stand by to let the lines go.’</p>

<p>He picked his way along the deck, past the two
torpedo tubes, and the twelve-pounder guns, and
up the ladder to the bridge. Here was no ‘big
ship’ routine, for the <i>Zero</i> only carried two officers
and just sufficient hands for the efficiency of the
ship, and the helmsman and a signal boy were in
sole charge of the bridge. It was not an extensive
structure, and consisted of a wheelhouse and
chart-room amidships, fronted with glass and
affording some protection against wind and rain,
and two wings thrown out to the vessel’s sides.</p>

<p>Just below the fore-part amidship was a twelve-pounder
gun, and beyond the whole back stretched
to the razor bow. She was not much to look at,
but she could still do her twenty-two knots and a
bit over if called upon, without unduly straining
herself or her twin engines.</p>

<p>Jenkins gave an order and the lines were thrown
off fore and aft. Then the engines began to move
and the <i>Zero</i> slid quietly astern. Aboard the
submarine alongside heads appeared from the
hatches, and a parting insult was cast in an undertone
at an able seaman who was coiling down a
line.</p>

<p>Slowly she cleared the sterns of the <i>Parentis</i>
and her satellites, swung round, came ahead, and
steadied on her course out of the harbour.</p>

<p>The fine weather still held and it was a lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
morning. The Fleet looked majestic and awe-inspiring,
and as the Torpedo Boat slipped past
a mammoth Dreadnought, an outsider comparing
the two might have been struck with the versatility
of the Navy’s work. Big ships or little, all were
marined by the same class of seamen, who never
knew from one day to another in what class or
size of ship they might be required to carry out
their duties.</p>

<p>The <i>Zero</i> picked her way between the vessels,
Jenkins training his glass on each as she went by.
Here the ship’s company were running round the
decks to the strains of a lively tune played by the
Marine Band, there detachments were parading
and squads under gunnery instruction. The Church
pendant flown by a third ship indicated that the
crew were at prayers, and divisions were mustering
to the strains of a bugle call on a fourth. Signals
were being hoisted, semaphores were busily waving
their arms, and picket boats and trawlers dotted
the open spaces between the vessels. It was
‘The Fleet,’ and accustomed to it as he was, the
sight sent a thrill through him as he took in the
scene.</p>

<p>As they cleared the gate and headed for the
open sea Burton came up to the bridge.</p>

<p>‘Fine weather for us, sir,’ he remarked, picking
up a pair of binoculars. ‘Light breeze and very
nearly a flat calm.’</p>

<p>‘It is. Raymond will have to be pretty cunning
if he’s going to get his attacks in unseen to-day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
The best weather for him is when there is just a
slight lop on the water. In a calm like this we
ought to see the “feather” of his old “look-stick”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
without much difficulty.’</p>

<p>‘Personally, I haven’t had much practice at
picking up periscopes, and it never seems to me
to be as easy as it sounds.’</p>

<p>‘Does take a bit of practice certainly, but with
a little—— Hallo, what’s that over there?’</p>

<p>‘“147” returning,’ he continued, lowering his
glasses. ‘Not more than six or seven miles off
either. That shows you how hard it is to see ’em
even when they’re on the surface. What’s the
time?’</p>

<p>‘Ten to nine, sir,’ said Burton, glancing at his
watch.</p>

<p>‘We’d better whack her up to twenty knots
then, and we’ll start a zig-zag at once to exercise
the helmsman. Raymond will be out any minute
now. We’re going to manœuvre anywhere in this
area,’ he added, with his finger on the chart, ‘so
we ought to be able to see him dive.’</p>

<p>The Torpedo Boat slid through the water with
an easy motion. The weather was clear, and here
outside the harbour the sea was nearly smooth,
and the razor fore-foot cut a great sheaf of water
away on either bow as her engines worked up to
top speed. Her gun-screws were closed up and her
look-outs posted. A large red flag was hoisted at
the yard-arm and every eye was kept glued on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the harbour mouth, watching for the first sight of
‘123’ on her way out.</p>

<p>Every five minutes Jenkins altered the course,
edging her gradually out to sea until the harbour
was left about ten miles astern. Arrived there,
the <i>Zero</i> ran up and down parallel to the land,
waiting for her foe to appear.</p>

<p>Presently the signal boy lowered his glass sharply
and reported, ‘“123” coming out, sir.’</p>

<p>Away over the entrance a small smudge showed
up, which the glasses revealed as Raymond’s
submarine doing her best on her gas engines.
Her bridge-screen was down and all appeared to
be ready for diving.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said Jenkins, after carefully inspecting
her. ‘Keep an eye on her and let me know when
she dives.’</p>

<p>Up went the telescope again, while the <i>Zero</i>
continued her hurried beat. Then down came
the glass, and ‘Diving, sir,’ the boy announced.</p>

<p>Away over on the starboard hand ‘147,’ who
had seen the red flag and knew its meaning, hauled
up to the Northward to approach the harbour by
a roundabout route and leave the Channel clear
for her submerged sister. Not a sign of Raymond’s
boat could now be seen, and the game of ‘touch’
began in earnest.</p>

<p>The <i>Zero</i> had to get back into harbour, while
‘123’ would exert every effort to torpedo her. It
was like looking for a poisoned needle in a bundle
of hay, and one realised what it is like when hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
submarines with real live torpedoes are in one’s
vicinity. Then, it occurred to Jenkins, there was
always the chance of something going seriously
wrong with Raymond’s boat, and he might run
her down unknowingly. Well, that was up to
her captain, and he must look out for himself.
Although he had given practice-attacks to many
submarines, the Torpedo Boat captain could never
overcome an uneasy feeling when his ‘enemy’
had dived. He couldn’t see them, they were away
under water, and if the attack were not made as
soon as he expected it, doubts would come over
him as to whether all were well below. Was anything
the matter, and ought he to stop, buoy the
spot, and return to harbour and report it? Then
when he was getting really anxious the submarine
would rise or fire at him, and he would have to
call himself a fool for his doubts and fears. He
was getting over it now, but he still felt the anxiety
if, for any reason, an attack were unusually prolonged.
Standing now in a wing of the bridge
with his binoculars glued to his eyes, he scanned
every inch of the water within a two miles’ radius.
On the other side Burton was similarly employed,
and look-outs in all parts of the ship were doing
their best with their naked eyes.</p>

<p>The helm was put over, and, always edging
towards the distant harbour, the <i>Zero</i> dodged and
turned and retraced her tracks to the skipper’s
orders. She pirouetted like a debutante, and it
seemed as if she fully appreciated the fact that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
all the while, somewhere beneath her, ‘123’ an
enemy for the moment, was watching and waiting
the opportunity to fire her torpedoes at her. The
sun shone brightly and danced on the wavelets
as they advanced to meet her. Occasionally a
light spray kissed her in passing, and the harbour
and ‘home’ drew nearer and more acceptable.
Away ahead a gull circled and flew down to the
wave tops, hovered an instant, wheeled up, and
finally fluttered slowly down as if seeking something.</p>

<p>Jenkins brought his glass down with a bang.</p>

<p>‘Hard-a-port!’ he cried. ‘There she is! Quarter
of a mile off, four points on the port bow.’</p>

<p>The <i>Zero</i> swung round in her own length, but
even as she turned two glittering objects showed
up in the water, leaving white streaks behind them
and approaching her at a prodigious speed.</p>

<p>‘Steady!’ shouted Jenkins. ‘Watch the torpedoes!
Stop her!’</p>

<p>One ‘fish’ passed well astern while the other
barely grazed under her counter. Five hundred
yards farther on they broke surface, and the red-painted
collision heads bobbed up and down in
silent mockery.</p>

<p>‘Away gig!’ piped the quartermaster, as Burton
came tumbling down the ladder. Two seamen
jumped into the boat while the others lowered her
to the water, where on the tables being unhooked
she towed alongside by her painter, which was
made fast from the <i>Zero’s</i> fo’c’sle. The man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
the stern-sheets grasped the tiller and sheered her
out, for the Torpedo Boat had not lost way yet
and was still going through the water at a good
five knots. Then quietly he eased in again, and
the remainder of the crew dropped into the boat
followed by the T.I. and Burton.</p>

<p>‘Ready!’ cried the latter, as he took his seat.
‘Let go, for’ard. Way together!’</p>

<p>As she sheered out, the Torpedo Boat slid swiftly
past her. When all was clear, her engines churned
astern and she gradually lost her weigh and came
to a standstill.</p>

<p>All this time Jenkins could see no sign of the
submarine, which had evidently retired to a discreet
depth after firing the ‘mouldies.’ Nothing was to
be seen of her as he looked all round in the proximity
of his vessel. Then suddenly he realised with a
shock that she was there, had risen just behind
him within a biscuit’s throw, bobbed up like a
Jack-in-the-Box, in fact. True, she was deep in
the water but her whole superstructure was above
surface, and as she lay there apparently deserted
she put him in mind of some monster of the deep
thrown up by an underwater explosion. Presently
the conning-tower hatch opened and Raymond
and the helmsman appeared. A moment or two
passed, an order was given, and she slid quietly
alongside, within hailing distance.</p>

<p>‘Saw you!’ shouted Jenkins triumphantly.
‘I spotted the periscope on my port bow and put
the helm hard-a-port just in time!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>‘Saw me, eh!’ Raymond bellowed back. ‘For
how long?’</p>

<p>‘Only about a half a minute. Just when you
had the “look-stick” up the last time. When
you fired, it must have been. You bore about
sou’-west as near as I could get it. I was afraid
it was too late and you were going to get your
shot in.’</p>

<p>‘I rather thought I should get you that time.
How did the “fish” run?’</p>

<p>‘Very well. A good straight run, but they
seemed to me to be a bit deep. What depth did
you have them set at?’</p>

<p>‘Sixteen feet. Best to be on the safe side. That
makes sure of them going well underneath you if
I get a good shot in, and leaves a margin in case
they rise a bit. I don’t want to damage ’em if I
can help it.’</p>

<p>‘No, of course not. Do you want another
run?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, please. I’d like to get rid of the other
two fish now we’re on the job. Same speed zig-zag
will do me nicely.’</p>

<p>‘Right-oh. I’m picking up your torpedoes now.
If you sheer off at once, by the time I get ’em
aboard you’ll be far enough away to dive. I’ll
get out to sea again to the limit of the area.’</p>

<p>‘All right. Thanks very much. But I shall be
some time, so don’t shake things too much. I’m
pumping out the tubes so as to go through the
whole show again for the benefit of the crew. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
haven’t had any attacks for some time and there
are some new hands in the boat.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind!’ bawled Jenkins, waving the
megaphone in adieux. ‘I’ll steam out slowly and
give you plenty of time. Cheer-oh.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile the gig had pulled quickly to the
nearer of the two torpedoes. The war-heads,
with their great charges of T.N.T., had been removed
the night before and the harmless collision
or peace-heads substituted. Other slight adjustments
had also been made in order to make them
sufficiently buoyant, to control their speed and the
depth and distance they should run, and now they
bobbed on the surface in a perpendicular position,
spouting water and pointing their noses to the
skies.</p>

<p>As they drew alongside the first of them the
T.I. grabbed at the wire grummet fixed to the
head, and passed the end of a line through it. The
torpedo was then pulled gently forward by the
boat’s crew until the expert could reach and force
back the starting lever, rendering harmless her
knife-edge propellers. Then off they pulled for
the other, the ‘mouldy’ touring astern and bobbing
after them.</p>

<p>Presently they had them both fast, and rowed
gently back to the <i>Zero</i>, Burton and the T.I. holding
the towing lines well apart to prevent them banging
against one another and injuring themselves.</p>

<p>Arrived alongside under the out-swung torpedo
davit, the boat was made fast and a line passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
over the propellers of the inboard ‘fish.’ Its other
end was thrown aboard, and the <i>Zero’s</i> men clapped
on to the nose and tail ropes and lifted her bodily
out of the water. Then the T.I. passed a thin steel
band round the body of the torpedo at its point of
balance, screwed in a shackle, hooked on the davit
runner, and all was ready.</p>

<p>‘Hoist away!’ cried Burton from the stern
sheets.</p>

<p>The torpedo crept quietly up the <i>Zero’s</i> side,
the men guiding her as she rose. When she cleared
the deck level, the davit was swung round and she
was gently lowered on to the wooden chocks prepared
to receive her. The second torpedo followed,
and all but two of the boat’s crew came aboard,
the coxswain and the bow oar remaining to get
her inboard. She was pulled under the davits,
hooked on, and as her dripping keel rose out of
the water, Jenkins put the telegraphs ahead and
the <i>Zero</i> was under weigh again.</p>

<p>Before the gig was up the T.I. was fussing round
the recovered torpedo like a hen round a long-lost
chicken, putting on tail clamps, draining the
engines, and generally seeing to their needs.</p>

<p>As Burton went up to the bridge, after seeing
the boat in, ‘123,’ who was now about a mile away,
slowly disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>First of all she settled down bodily in the water
until her superstructure was awash. Slowly her
decks submerged, leaving only her gun and conning-tower
visible. Then as she sank deeper, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
periscope’s standard sticking out of the water was
the only evidence of her existence. The standard
vanished, and through binoculars the periscope
alone could be seen, leaving a thin wake behind
it. Then that, too, disappeared, and there was
no longer anything to tell the watchers that ‘123’
had ever existed.</p>

<p>Down in her internals the crew was at diving-stations
ready for the next attack. In the fore-end,
where Seagrave was in charge of the torpedo
tubes, the electric light winked and shimmered
on the round copper doors. The T.I. and two seamen
were busy with valves and levers, and the sound
of a pump rose above the hissing of escaping air.
Raymond was in the control room, by the periscope,
and Boyd stood by, ready to record every
course and bearing on the chart and carry out
any special orders the captain might give.</p>

<p>She had dived to thirty feet as a preliminary
canter in order to get well clear of the Torpedo
Boat, before showing her periscope, and now, at
an order from Raymond, the two coxswains slowly
brought her up. Very gingerly the captain raised
the instrument, took a quick glance round, and
lowered it again.</p>

<p>‘Thirty feet,’ he ordered. ‘Course 20 deg.,
Boyd. <i>Zero</i> bearing 120 deg. We’ll let her get
well out to sea again and have another smack at
her on her way back.’</p>

<p>‘All ready for’ard, sir,’ said Seagrave, coming
aft. ‘We haven’t had a great deal of practice in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the fore-end lately, but that new man seems to
understand his job. I’ve drained the tubes, so
that we can go through the whole routine again.’</p>

<p>‘Very good. I’ll let you know in plenty of time.
We’ve got to get old Jinks this journey, remember.
He mustn’t be allowed to crow twice. Up periscope,’
he added to the able seaman who was controlling
the movements of the ‘look-stick’ so that the
captain might be free to make his observations.</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he continued, finishing his brief
survey. ‘Carry on for’ard. Jinks has turned
back now. Keep her at eighteen feet, coxswain.’</p>

<p>Another rapid glance a few minutes later showed
him what he was waiting for, and as the periscope
came down he prepared for the attack.</p>

<p>‘Alter course to 175 deg., bearing 160 deg.,’ he
called out. ‘Speed up 500. Flood the tubes.’</p>

<p>‘Flood the tubes,’ repeated Boyd along the
tunnel of the boat, and ‘flood the tubes’ came
back from Seagrave in the fore-end.</p>

<p>Round the tube doors a buzz of preparation
took place. Before opening the bow-cap and
exposing the outboard doors at the farther end,
through which the torpedoes would presently be
launched by compressed air, the tubes had to be
filled with water. It was necessary to flood them
from the water already in the fore-trimming
tank, because if outside water were allowed to
enter the boat the extra weight would put her
down by the head and seriously upset her trim,
probably even rendering an attack impossible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Then, when the tubes were flooded, the bow-cap
could be swung, and on the order to fire compressed
air would hurl the torpedoes from their cages, the
trippers would engage and force back the starting
levers as they slid out, and they would be away
from the mark at forty knots.</p>

<p>‘Open the drains and vents!’ cried Seagrave.
‘Air on the fore trim line!’</p>

<p>Away aft in the control room Hoskins worked
at a spindle on the air manifold, and a rumbling
and gurgling indicated that water was being blown
from the tank up into the tubes.</p>

<p>Seagrave and the T.I. were watching the gauges
as the level slowly rose. Up, up it came, and as
the thin bubble line reached the top, a spurt of
water shot out from the vents.</p>

<p>‘Shut off drains and blows,’ cried the ‘Sub.’
‘Close the vents!’</p>

<p>The tubes were now full, and with a few turns
of a wheel he forced the great bow-cap for’ard
off its seating. Then with his foot on a shining
brass pedal, with a single heave of a lever, he swung
the whole mass round till the indicator showed
that the open doors were in line with the tubes.
Something fell into place with a click, the cap was
worked back on to its seating, and the torpedoes
were free for their mission.</p>

<p>‘Charge firing tanks’ was the next order, and
as the air sighed and soughed through the pipes,
‘All ready for’ard, sir!’ he shouted.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay,’ answered Raymond, with his eye at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
periscope. ‘Bearing of <i>Zero</i> 165 deg. What’s her
depth?’</p>

<p>‘Eighteen feet, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Right. Down periscope.’</p>

<p>Boyd was working furiously at his chart, laying
off the bearings and courses and making notes of
the orders given for future reference. All this
would be gone through afterwards in ward room
and cabin, and it was best to be well prepared.</p>

<p>Up went the periscope again. The men in the
control room guessed they were nearing the moment
of attack and steadied themselves in readiness.</p>

<p>‘Bearing 170 deg. What’s her depth?’</p>

<p>‘Sixteen feet, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Keep her down, man. Don’t let her break
surface. Down with her,’ said Raymond sharply.</p>

<p>The coxswains worked frantically and took her
down to twenty feet. Then up once more and the
periscope raised a mere few inches.</p>

<p>‘Bearing 175 deg. Full fields. Stand by!’
shouted Raymond, and down came the periscope
again.</p>

<p>The motors eased down as the fields were increased
by the torpedo ratings working at the
motor-boards in the after compartment. Boyd
dropped his notebook and stood by the firing gear.</p>

<p>‘Deflection’s twenty, sir,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Open “stand by” valves,’ cried Seagrave.
‘Open the cocks on the firing line.’ A minute’s
quick glance round, then ‘ready, sir.’</p>

<p>The periscope went up a few inches. Raymond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
was bending down almost on his back now in his
efforts to show above water as little of his ‘look-stick’
as possible.</p>

<p>‘Port ten,’ he ordered. ‘Keep her at her depth.
Steady the helm. Starboard five. Steady again....
Fire!’</p>

<p>Boyd wrenched down the firing levers, and the
boat shuddered through all her frames as the
torpedoes were hauled forward. There was a
great soughing of air as the firing tanks recharged,
the coxswains spun their wheels to counteract
the loss of weight, and down came the periscope.</p>

<p>‘Eighty feet,’ said Raymond, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The <i>Zero</i> had turned her head out to sea for the
second attack. Jenkins had carefully marked
the spot where the submarine had dived and felt
fairly confident of picking up the periscope a
second time. Burton also was beginning to alter
his opinion about the difficulty of spotting a periscope.
Perhaps it was easier than he had thought
it. True, he hadn’t seen it last time, but then he
was looking out on the other side of the ship and
couldn’t be expected to have picked it up.</p>

<p>He crossed over to where the captain was
standing.</p>

<p>‘How far are we going out, sir?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘About the same distance, but we’ll keep her at
this speed till we turn round for the run. Raymond
wants to do some fancy work or other to train his
crew.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>‘Very good, sir. I expect he was pretty sick at
missing us last time. He thinks he’s rather a knut
at attacks, doesn’t he?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he doesn’t mind,’ laughed the other. ‘It
won’t worry him, he’s one of the best. And don’t
run away with the idea that he won’t get us,
because his blood’s up now, and it would be hard
to find a better submarine officer when he really
means business. How does the lighthouse bear?’</p>

<p>‘About another three miles to go,’ replied Burton,
peering along the azimuth ring.</p>

<p>‘We’ll carry on like this for another quarter of
an hour then before we turn round. Warn the
look-outs when we start the run.’</p>

<p>The Torpedo Boat steamed on at about twelve
knots to the limit of the area. Her red flag warned
all intruders of the nature of her errand, and any
passing craft gave a wide berth to the region in
which she was working.</p>

<p>Presently Burton looked into the compass
again and announced that she had reached the
turning-point. The <i>Zero</i> swung round on the
course for home, and Jenkins bent over the chart.</p>

<p>‘Here we are,’ he said, marking the spot with a
pencil, ‘and Raymond dived there. I expect he’ll
attack us about four miles this side of the harbour.
Our course is 270 deg. Whack her up to full speed
and start a zig-zag.’</p>

<p>The telegraph clanged, and the helmsman put
his wheel over at an order from Burton. The <i>Zero</i>
jumped ahead and began on her erratic run for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
home. Scarcely a ripple moved the surface of the
water now that the light wind had dropped, and
the odds were strongly in favour of their spotting
the periscope long before Raymond could get into
a position favourable enough to fire his torpedoes.</p>

<p>With her slender bow slicing up a narrow trench
of water the Torpedo Boat raced on, turning and
zig-zagging to the slightest touch of the helm.
Once Jenkins thought he saw the submarine and
gave a sharp order, but it proved to be nothing,
and he countermanded it immediately. Then
Burton thought he saw her, and after that he saw
periscopes everywhere where there were none to
be seen. A haunted feeling came over him, and
he thanked his stars it was not an enemy boat that
was after them. It seemed rather hopeless trying
to find her after all.</p>

<p>But Jenkins, the veteran, thought otherwise.
He had done this job on many occasions, and rather
fancied himself at bowling out his submarine
friends, and as they approached the suspected
area he lowered his glasses and took a final glance
at the chart.</p>

<p>‘Keep a good look-out now,’ he shouted to the
watching men. ‘Starboard bow probably.’</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that a submarine could
approach the little craft and remain undetected.
A dozen men were on the alert scanning every
inch of the surface in the vicinity of the vessel,
and those on the bridge kept their glasses sweeping
in all directions. Now that the moment had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
arrived, an expectant hush fell on the watchers,
and each strained his eyes for the first sight of the
slightest ‘feather’ or other indication of the enemy’s
presence. Even the unnatural behaviour of a
gull called for attention, for the wily birds can see
and give warning of a periscope long before the
human eye can detect it. It was like a game of
hide-and-seek, and the look-outs experienced the
feelings of a stranger stumbling along in the dark,
knowing that somewhere round the corner his
enemy is waiting to stick a knife in his back.</p>

<p>The expected danger-spot was reached, every
eye on the alert. Over went the helm, they were
through it; it was passed and the tension relaxed.</p>

<p>Still there was no sign from the depths, and
Jenkins slowly lowered his glass again.</p>

<p>‘He’s missed us, I think,’ he said. ‘We must
have given him the slip.’</p>

<p>‘A bit too quick for him,’ remarked Burton
complacently.</p>

<p>Save for themselves the ocean seemed untenanted,
and there lay the harbour a bare two miles ahead.</p>

<p>‘Don’t crow till you’re out of the wood, though,’
went on the skipper. ‘He may have us yet.’</p>

<p>Then suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, his
eye caught a glint in the water.</p>

<p>‘Hard-a-starboard!’ he snapped. ‘Over with
it!’</p>

<p>Too late! A flash of white and creamy bubbles
told where one torpedo had rushed across the
bow. The other shot clean under the Torpedo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Boat, was lost for an instant, and reappeared on
the other side like an arrow from a bow. Two
cables away they broke surface, and the red peace-heads
bobbed up and down as witnesses of the
attack.</p>

<p>‘Got us, by Jove!’ roared Jenkins. ‘A beautiful
shot! Steady the helm! Stop her!’</p>

<p>Still there was no sign of ‘123,’ and with her
engines going astern the <i>Zero</i> gradually lost her
weigh and came to a standstill.</p>

<p>The boat was called away and Burton despatched
to retrieve the spent torpedoes, and presently a
dark wedge-shaped object pushed up above the
surface and revealed itself as the submarine’s
periscope standard. The bridge, the gun, and
finally the superstructure appeared, and she was
up from the eighty foot dive which she had
undertaken to increase the realism of the attack.
An enemy who had seen the torpedoes on their
mission would have taken the warning and cast
about for his assailant, if he had not been blown
to a better world.</p>

<p>She lay on the surface about half a mile off,
menacing and silent. The figures were seen moving
on her bridge, and she slowly dropped alongside,
while her telescopic mast went up in sections and
the White Ensign was hoisted to the peak.</p>

<p>‘Beautiful shot!’ shouted Jenkins, as she came
within hailing distance. ‘A real ripper! One went
just ahead and the other right underneath me.
That depth you set them at was about right and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
they ran straight. If I’d been a Hun you’d have
blown me to smithereens.’</p>

<p>‘Did you see me?’ howled Raymond.</p>

<p>‘No fear. Never saw a vestige of periscope.
In fact, I thought you’d missed me.’</p>

<p>‘That’s good. I nearly broke surface once, and
I was afraid it would be no use carrying on. Will
you bring the “fish” in and I’ll take ’em from
you when we get alongside the <i>Parentis</i>?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, all right. I’m picking them up now. See
you later.’</p>

<p>Raymond started the motors and ‘123’ drew
ahead. Presently Burton returned with the torpedoes,
which were carefully hoisted, and as the
boat was swung to the davit-heads the <i>Zero</i> got
under weigh. Ahead in a cloud from her exhaust
was the submarine, on her gas engines now, and
putting her best screw forward for the harbour.
Permission to enter was sought and granted from
the Flagship in hoists of coloured bunting and
the exercise was over.</p>

<p>As the <i>Zero</i> gathered speed the captain looked
up from the chart table.</p>

<p>‘This is where we come in, I think,’ he said with
a grin; ‘shove her on to full.’</p>

<p>Down below the telegraph clanged and the small
craft shook herself like an expectant terrier. Then
she began to feel the added impetus and rapidly
overhauled her slower rival. The Heads of the
harbour entrance opened out as they approached,
and the trawler at the gate hoisted the clearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
signal. Beyond, the masts and funnels of the
Fleet could be seen, and away to the southward
an Admiralty collier was punching along with
her cargo of diamonds for the ever hungry bunkers.</p>

<p>As they buzzed past their recent enemy, Jenkins
gave an order to the signal boy, and that ingenuous
youth began waving the semaphore arms with
evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>‘Will report your return,’ he spelt out.</p>

<p>A pause followed. Then a figure was seen to
clamber to a position of vantage on the submarine’s
standard and there was a flash of red and yellow
bunting.</p>

<p>‘What does he say?’ asked Raymond, when the
message came to an end.</p>

<p>The boy saluted. ‘“123” to <i>Zero</i>, sir, “Your
signal not understood. Will report sinking of
<i>Zero</i> by torpedo on my arrival at base.” Eleven
twenty-five, code time, sir.’</p>

<p>‘What did I tell you, Burton?’ laughed the
captain. ‘It’s no good trying to get to windward
of Raymond. He’s always undefeated to the end.’</p>

<p>‘Precocity, I call it,’ said the other, who was
bitterly grieved at the downfall of Jenkins’s attempt
to score off the wily ‘hate-boat.’</p>

<p>The signal boy turned his back sharply and
busied himself with his flags, while he hid a smile
behind a grimy hand. He was used to this sort
of chaff among the gods, but experience had taught
him that it was not well to display too keen a
sense of humour on these occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>Three minutes later, with her engines at a reduced
speed, the <i>Zero</i> took the gate and sped on up the
harbour. As she passed the big ships the boy
pounced on an answering pendant, ran it up to
the yard-arm, and glued his eye to the telescope.</p>

<p>‘<i>Parentis</i> to <i>Zero</i>,’ he spelt out. ‘Moorings
alongside <i>Parentis</i> occupied. Anchor in No. 4
berth.’</p>

<p>‘Down answer,’ he added, and the pendant
fluttered to the deck.</p>

<p>‘All right, carry on for’ard, Burton,’ said the
captain. ‘She’ll have to come alongside us in the
afternoon and take the torpedoes in. Starboard
anchor. Forty-five on the windlass.’</p>

<p>Burton departed to superintend the mooring
operations, and the Torpedo Boat picked up her
berth and let go her anchor without unnecessary
fuss.</p>

<p>Meanwhile ‘123’ had followed her into the
harbour at a more leisurely gait, observing a
discreet decorum now that she was under the
paternal eye of the big ships. As she approached
the <i>Parentis</i> her gas engines were shut down, and
she dropped alongside on her motors and made
fast to the trot. Raymond sent for the T.I., and
arrangements were made for the parting and overhauling
of the torpedoes that had been fired, and
also held communion with the coxswain with
regard to shifting alongside the <i>Zero</i> for them,
after lunch. Boyd shut down the Sperry compass,
and by the time Seagrave had seen everything in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
order the three officers decamped to clean themselves
for the meal.</p>

<p>‘A most profitable morning’s work,’ announced
Raymond, as they entered the crowded ward
room. ‘My congratulations to you, Seagrave,
on the way the “fish” ran, and to you, Boyd, for
the masterly manner in which you recorded our
doings. Who’s having a gin?’</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>After dinner that evening the captain of the
depot came down to the ward room and was hailed
with the respectful welcome of a great man and
a comrade. Drinks were passed on him, and he
was led to an arm-chair near the fire where the
boat-captains were discussing their usual topics,
‘shop’ and motor-bicycles. The Torpedo Lieutenant
was in good form and regaled his superiors
with a lengthy account of his unrewarded struggles
to benefit a misguided humanity, and of his abject
failure. Austin and Blake brought a discussion
on the merits of American Diesel engines to him
for a casting decision, and the Staff Paymaster
bemoaned the removal of a certain cherished
underling to another sphere of utility.</p>

<p>By-and-by, in a lull in the general conversation,
the Captain spoke of what was in his mind.</p>

<p>‘How did the attacks go to-day, Raymond?’
he asked. ‘You haven’t told me anything beyond
the bare report.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing to tell you, sir. They went pretty
well. One came off and the other didn’t.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>‘That’s all rubbish, sir,’ put in Jenkins, who
was one of the guests of the evening. ‘I only just
saw him the first time, and the second attack
defeated me completely. I was absolutely Hunned
and never saw a thing.’</p>

<p>The Captain’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>‘Not so bad, Raymond,’ he said. ‘Not so bad.
A little more practice and you’ll become one of
the wonders of the deep.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know about that, sir,’ laughed Raymond.
‘I ought to have got both attacks in,
really, and I only just got him the last time by a
fluke.’</p>

<p>The Captain smiled and changed the subject.
At the other end of the ward room somebody
was playing the piano and the strains of ‘The
Admiral’s Broom’ rose in a deep baritone. When
the chorus was reached the party round the fire
joined <span class="locked">in:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘I’ve a whip at the mast said he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For a whip is the sign for me,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I ride and rule the Sea....’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The good old words filled the room and floated
up through the skylight to the silent quarter-deck,
where the officer of the watch paced up and
down, and the anchored ships showed up as deeper
blotches in the darkness. Overhead the wireless
buzzed and crackled, and the lapping of the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
between the boats alongside sounded like mermaids’
kisses.</p>

<p>A quartermaster on his way forward paused
by the open skylight listening to the tinkle of the
piano.</p>

<p>‘Strewth,’ he muttered. ‘Orficers ’avin’ a good
time,’ and relapsed into silence as a signalman
pattered by to relieve his mate on the bridge.</p>

<p>As the song came to an end a boy operator
knocked at the ward-room door and handed a
message to the Captain, who read it and put it in
his pocket. Another song was beginning, and the
singers were clustering round the piano. Duty
called him, and as the song reached the noisy
stage, he left with a quiet ‘good-night,’ and returned
to his lonely quarters.</p>

<p>He was no mean judge of character.</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> next day was Sunday, and as the fine weather
still held, the Captain of the depot announced to
the First Lieutenant his intention of inspecting
the boats. Thence was much heart-burning and
striving and a prodigious amount of work, the net
result being that the nine boats shone inside and
out like the proverbial new pins, and the crews,
with the exception of those who were to stand
the rounds, clad in ‘Number Threes,’ fell in on
their superstructures with vacant ‘attention’ expressions
on their usually classic features.</p>

<p>But before this happy result could be arrived
at there was much to be done ... and said, for
it must be admitted that there were those among
the boat captains who held the opinion that inspections
were an unnecessary nuisance, carried
out with the sole intention of harassing the
inspected.</p>

<p>The First Lieutenant of the <i>Parentis</i> had given
out the cheery news after breakfast, and a rush
had followed on the part of the ‘Subs,’ unusually
tidy in their Sunday rigs, to see that their boats
were in a fit condition to withstand the piercing
gaze of the Captain’s eagle eye. The boat captains
learnt the news not without unmixed feelings, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
with shrill cries of horror and reproach the unfortunate
Number One was hurled from the ward
room. Bitter were the reproaches of one, Blake,
whose control room had been painted but the
day before, while Austin and several others had
work going on and improvements under weigh
which they didn’t want disturbed. Raymond
surveyed the matter with the stony calm of a
fatalist, while the Torpedo Lieutenant alone maintained
his unruffled serenity and dropped pearls
of wisdom for the comfort and instruction of the
discomforted captains.</p>

<p>‘What you fellows really lack,’ he proclaimed
from the depths of an arm-chair and between
puffs of an after-breakfast pipe, ‘is the power of
organisation. The present crisis is an excellent
example. At nine a.m. the ‘owner’ announces
his intention of inspecting the boats after divisions
and prayers, that is at about ten-thirty. Now,
mark the result. Nine ‘Subs’ fly at the rate of
knots out of the ward room, run round in circles
with their hands to their heads, dive down into
the boats and begin harassing unfortunate and
peace-loving matlows. As regards you people,
you’re all completely defeated. You sit here,
do nothing, and growl like blazes, when as a matter
of fact it doesn’t affect you in the least. The ‘Subs’
do all the work and report when the boats are
ready. You then go down and inspect them yourselves,
find fault with everything, have the whole
place turned upside down, and wait till the dust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
has settled. At the last minute you have it all
put back again as it was before, and stand by for
the Captain. Now what you want is organisation.
No matter what’s going on you ought to be ready
for an inspection at any moment of the day. Mark
the ordered routine of my own blameless existence.
I rise at eight-thirty each morning as fresh as a
lark, and if I’m lucky manage to consume a little
breakfast. From then till lunch or cocktail time
I maintain a complete and unruffled calm, seated
daily in the same arm-chair, unless the claims of the
Goddess Work call me to her altars. From lunch
until tea I meditate in my bunk, and from tea till
dinner I give out hints on the home, and generally
instructive and edifying remarks from my present
seat of vantage. Bed follows dinner as the fruit
follows the flower, and my ordered and well disciplined
day is at an end. It will be hard for you,
and I foresee many difficulties, but you really
must make an effort to follow my example,’ and
the Torpedo Lieutenant lay back gasping and
mopped his fevered brow with a bandana of barbaric
colouring.</p>

<p>‘The point is,’ grumbled Austin, not taking any
notice of him, ‘that in war time one can’t keep the
boat up to the peace standard. It’s not possible.
There’s far too much work to be done, for one
thing, and considering the amount of sea time we
put in I think we do pretty well in keeping the
boats as clean as they are.’</p>

<p>‘That’s the crux of the whole question,’ replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
Raymond; ‘in war time the ‘owner’ doesn’t
expect to see the boats in the same state of spit
and polish as he has been used to in happier times.
What he looks for is general efficiency in boats,
officers, and men. That’s the reason he and I get
on so splendidly. No, don’t heave that book,
Jimmy; I’ve got my number one monkey jacket
on, and if I have to chastise you I shall get it
creased. Hallo! there’s the bugle for divisions.
See you later.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe in inspections at all in war
time,’ said another of the party, as a general move
was made for the door. ‘Unfair, I call it. Brings
the war home too much.’</p>

<p>Overhead the scurrying of heavily-shod feet
and the sound of sharp orders told that the ships’
company was mustering by divisions for the
Captain’s inspection, and the boat skippers cleared
out to their boats to see that all was in readiness.</p>

<p>Down in ‘123’ the last finishing touches were
being applied when Raymond arrived. Everything
that brass polish and elbow grease could
cause to shine, shone with a satisfactory brilliance,
and whatever couldn’t shine was discreetly stowed
away and hidden from the vulgar gaze. When all
was in readiness, Raymond and the ‘Sub’ made
a tour of inspection in search of possible defects
or anything that might meet with the disapproval
of authority.</p>

<p>‘This hydroplane motor,’ said the latter, putting
his hand on a large black object that looked rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
like a small mine. ‘It’s been running hot lately.
Have to look at it to-morrow. “Owner” won’t
know that, though.’</p>

<p>‘Um, no. She doesn’t look too bad. Tell Hoskins
to stand the rounds in the engine-room, T.I. in the
fore-end, and second coxswain in the control-room.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir. Hallo! they’re at prayers,’ he
added as the strains of a hymn accompanied by
the Marine Band floated down the hatch. ‘Not
much longer now. I think she’ll do, sir. Fall the
hands in on the upper deck, coxswain.’</p>

<p>The last brass rag and lump of waste were stowed
away and the men scrambled up on deck. ‘123’
was a pleasure to the eye and a credit to the makers
of liquid metal polish. All down the long tunnel
of her inside, from the engines to the torpedo-tube
doors, her steel and brass and copper winked and
twinkled in the electric light, her white enamel
was spotless, and her deckcloths were a glory to
behold.</p>

<p>Raymond took a final look round. ‘Good enough,’
he said, as he went up the conning-tower followed
by the ‘Sub.’ ‘Now for the ordeal by fire.’</p>

<p>On deck the crew had fallen in in one long single
line facing towards the parent ship. Ten men
forward of the conning-tower and as many aft,
all dressed in their best suits of ‘Number Three,’
and looking remarkably spick and span and on
their metal. They were standing at ease now and
sucking their teeth in anticipation, after the manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
of the A.B. who is in the rattle or otherwise undergoing
some order or other. By the gang plank to
the next boat, for ‘123’ was the outside vessel,
and three of her sisters lay between her and the
<i>Parentis</i>, stood the coxswain with his boatswain’s
pipe in hand, and Raymond took his stand beside
him in readiness to receive the Post-Captain on
board.</p>

<p>Seagrave stood by in charge of the crew and
Boyd was on the bridge, which was the only remaining
unoccupied space on the upper deck.
Between them and the <i>Parentis</i> the crews of the
other three boats were drawn up in the same
manner, and on the other side of the depot-ship
were five more boats in a similar state of cleanliness
and innocent expressions. They all flew
their newest and largest ensigns, and looked very
smart and business-like in their Sunday dresses.</p>

<p>The music on the <i>Parentis</i> quarter-deck drew
to a close. Three hundred men came to attention
and replaced their caps simultaneously, and the
chaplain disappeared aft, his surplice waving in
the breeze, as the Church pendant fluttered down
to the bridge. Another order and the ship’s
company faced forward and moved off the quarter-deck,
the band, which had struck up a lively march,
wheeled in behind the rear division, and the
ceremony was at an end.</p>

<p>A dramatic pause followed, and then the figure
of Captain Charteris appeared at the port-gangway.
The boatswain’s mate of the <i>Parentis</i> and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
coxswain of the inside boat, which happened to
be Blake’s, twittered on their pipes as he descended,
and then he was lost to view in the internals of
the boat. He had come alone, unattended by
First Lieutenants or other minions, which augered
well for the results of the inspection.</p>

<p>Austin, whose boat was next inside Raymond’s,
turned round with a laugh.</p>

<p>‘Hope the “old man” doesn’t run up against
Blake’s white paint,’ he said. ‘Pretty small chance
for us if he does.’</p>

<p>‘Trust Blake to watch that,’ came the answer.
‘He won’t want his precious paint disturbed even
by the coat of a full-fledged Captain.’ Once more
silence and expectancy, and then the Captain
reappeared up the hatch followed by Blake, who
looked moist and anxious but happy withal.</p>

<p>‘Seems to be in a good temper,’ whispered
Raymond to Seagrave. ‘Look out, here he comes.’</p>

<p>With much saluting and piping Captain Charteris
stepped across to the next boat and the ceremony
was repeated. When he once more rose to view,
however, some ten minutes later, his face appeared
clouded and he boarded Austin’s boat with a briskness
that evidenced that all had not been well
with the vessel he had just inspected.</p>

<p>‘Wonder what’s up,’ murmured Seagrave. ‘He
looks a bit sickish about something.’</p>

<p>‘Man in a dirty rig, I expect, or else he asked
too many questions,’ replied Raymond. ‘Our
turn next.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>At last, after a seemingly interminable interval,
the Captain once more rose to view, and joy! the
wily Austin had smoothed his ruffled temper.
The great man said a few final words, laughed,
and turned towards ‘123.’ Blake’s coxswain, pipe
to lips, made a scarcely perceptible sign, and then,
as the Captain set foot on the gang-plank, he and
the coxswain of ‘123’ simultaneously burst into
a duet of piping, shrilling, and twittering as each
tried to out-do the other.</p>

<p>‘Ship’s company, ’shun!’ shouted Seagrave, as
the men sprang to attention; the officers saluted,
and Raymond stepped forward to do the honours.</p>

<p>Still the piping continued, rising and falling in
regular cadence till the performers were red in
the face and near to bursting. Then again that
almost invisible sign, this time from Raymond’s
coxswain, and the sound of the pipes ceased as if
suddenly cut off and smothered with a blanket.</p>

<p>The Captain returned the salute and looked
down the line of stolid faces. A student of physiognomy
would have seen much food for reflection
once he had penetrated the mask of stolid look-your-best
that a man at attention always assumes.</p>

<p>In the first place there was Raymond, a tall
upright figure, very much the Naval Officer, and
just now very much the captain of the boat. Had
he been asked why he had joined the Service he
would hardly have been able to give a very clear
reason. ‘Father wanted me to, you know. Thought
I ought to,’ would probably have been his answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
accompanied by much hesitation and a deal of
stammering. As a matter of fact he came of a
family which boasted members of the Service for
many generations back, one of whom had been a
Vice-Admiral. As an only son it had seemed nothing
less than duty that he should follow in his father’s
footsteps and carry the name on in the Service.
He was one of the older officers, with a <i>Britannia</i>
training, who had entered the Submarine Service
as a Lieutenant in the experimental days, and who,
after six long years as a junior, had gained his
well-earned command several years before the
outbreak of war, and had gradually worked his
way up to command one of the later classes of
submarine, and was even now on turn for a bigger
boat. In the ward room he was a witty and pleasant
companion. As a submarine captain we are able
to judge for ourselves.</p>

<p>Then there was Seagrave, looking at present
rather nervous and wearing a strained expression
on his youthful face. Perhaps he was thinking
of the hydroplane-motor, or perhaps he was merely
worried over the general result of the inspection.
He had received his training under the more recent
Osborne-Dartmouth scheme, and his presence in
the Submarine Service was the outcome of the
war and the new Navy methods. The large number
of boats that had recently been built had necessitated
an increase in the ranks of submarine officers,
and as it had not been advisable to drain the
general service of too many experienced watch-keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
lieutenants, the Admiralty had hit on the
plan of entering Sub-Lieutenants as seconds in
command of boats. They received a course of
submarine work, and, thanks to their previous
training, which included engineering among other
things, and their own keenness and intelligence,
the scheme had worked very well. Many of them
would be in command of boats at a much younger
age than their present captains had gained a
command, but the responsibilities and cares of a
submarine life had amply fitted them for their
positions.</p>

<p>Boyd, the R.N.R. Lieutenant, was another
offspring of the war, both as regards his being in
the Navy at all and as regards his presence in the
Submarine Service. Prior to the war the Royal
Naval Reserve had contained comparatively few
officers, and commissions had been hard to obtain,
but after the first few months of hostilities the
Admiralty had realised that they had not sufficient
trained seamen for their needs, and had reopened
the Reserve with a call for more officers. The
result far exceeded expectation, for the officers of
the Merchant Service flocked to the colours in
thousands, and after a course of training were sent
afloat as watch-keepers in any class of ship from
Super-Dreadnoughts to trawlers. The growth in
size and capabilities of submarines, and their more
arduous duties, had necessitated that they should
have an additional officer soon after war started,
and the result was that each of the bigger boats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
was supplied with a Lieutenant of the Royal Naval
Reserve. His duties were entirely those of a seaman,
as he was the navigator, took a large slice of the
watches, and looked after the confidential books
and gyro compass. Boyd himself had served his
first four years at sea in a sailing ship or ‘wind
jammer,’ and had, after becoming an officer,
transferred into steam and done a voyage or two
in tramp. At the outbreak of war he had left one
of the great mail companies of the Western Ocean,
to which he intended to return when all was over.
The Navy life did not appeal to him very strongly,
and he was looking forward to a return to his old
work.</p>

<p>The next in order was the coxswain, a first-class
Petty Officer who had joined submarines as
an able seaman about the same time as Raymond
had entered that Service. Perhaps he had wanted
to get married, and had been attracted by the
increased pay, or it may have been that a friend
in a submarine had told him stories of the life and
privileges pertaining to it that had fired his imagination.
Like most men of his age he had joined
the Navy as a boy and been trained in a sailing
brig, whence he had eventually emerged and
blossomed out, until he received his anchor and
was rated leading seaman after two years in submarines.
Raymond had, owing to a vacancy, tried
him as a second coxswain, with the result that in
course of time he was promoted to the rank of
Petty Officer and coxswain, and had followed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
captain from boat to boat for several years in
succession.</p>

<p>The second coxswain was a middle-aged leading
seaman on turn for Petty Officer who had been
through much the same training as his senior,
and hoped for promotion as soon as he received
his ‘crossed killicks.’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Then there came the gun-layer, the cook, and
six able seamen, all A.B.’s of much the same age,
men about twenty-six who aspired to be coxswains
or Torpedo Instructors in due course. They again
were new Navy, and had received their early
training in shore barracks and training cruisers.
The Submarine Service is essentially a voluntary
one, and it would be difficult to ascertain why
they had ever joined. Probably if they were asked
they would have replied ‘private reasons,’ and
sucked their teeth noisily.</p>

<p>Then came the T.I., Torpedo Instructor or
Torpedo Gunner’s Mate, a Petty Officer and electrical
expert, who, after going through the same early
trials as the two coxswains, had specialised in
electricity after being rated A.B. He had received
his first upward step when he became an S.T. or
Seaman Torpedo man, and shortly after he was
promoted to Leading Seaman the specialist rating
of Leading Torpedo Man had been granted him.
With maturity and experience had come the rank
of Petty Officer and Torpedo Instructor, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
he was one of those who knew more about the
internals of those highly mechanical engines of
death than the rest of the crew put together. He
lived in a whirl of balance chamber doors and
hydrostatic valves, and gibbered in his sleep of
reducers and ignition delay gear.</p>

<p>The L.T.O., who was a new Navy man and the
T.I.’s second-in-command, was in charge under
Seagrave of all the electrical appliances and motors
in the boat. He was an expert at finding ‘earths’
and short circuits, and was notable among his
kind in that he was nimble-fingered and could
‘make’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> a switch without breaking it.</p>

<p>The engine-room staff was headed by Chief
Engine Room Artificer Hoskins, a hoary-headed
old sinner of the old school, who could coax a Diesel
engine to run on air or coal-dust if necessary and
was, moreover, in a permanent state of growl.
Raymond swore by him, and had, like the coxswain,
taken him from ship to ship in his upward
career. He had joined the Navy as a fitter and
turner at the age of twenty-two, having just completed
his apprenticeship in one of the great shipbuilding
yards on the Tyne, and had been entered
as a Fourth Class Artificer. His keenness and
wonderful ability with anything mechanical had
urged him to join the Submarine Service, where
he was practically in charge of his own engines.
Give him an oil-can and a lump of waste, varied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
occasionally by a foot-rule and Macmahon wrench,
and he would be happy for hours.</p>

<p>The second, third, and fourth E.R.A.’s were all
much younger men who had joined under the new
scheme as Boy Artificers at the training college
at Devonport, whence they had emerged, having
received all their knowledge from the Service, and
in due course been rated Artificers, 4th Class.
They were now slowly working their way up, and
had joined the Submarine Service since the war,
when the necessity for capable men had inspired
them with the wish for more authority than fell
to their lots in the engine-rooms of a Battleship.</p>

<p>The Stoker Petty Officer was a bearded and
efficient ruffian, and the oldest man in the boat.
Unlike the seamen, the stokers do not join the
Navy as boys, but at about the age of eighteen,
and this particular old sinner had had rather a
rough time of it in his early days. However, he
had kept going, and as only men of good character
are admitted to submarines, it speaks well of him
that he had not fallen by the wayside. In a submarine
he had seen freedom from dirt and eternal
coal shovelling, raking, and slicing, as well as extra
pay and other privileges, and the added dangers
of the life did not seem to worry him in the least.</p>

<p>His right-hand man was the Leading Stoker,
who had seen much the same side of life as his
senior, to whose rating he was now aspiring. He
was a man of good solid worth, a little fond of the
bottle; and possessed of many relations whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
sudden deaths necessitated his immediate presence
in the home circle. But he was a good man and
knew his work and the men under him, and the
engines never ran so smoothly as when he was
superintending the oiling and other equally
necessary operations.</p>

<p>Finally, there were the six First Class Stokers,
young men not long in submarines who were very
anxious to get on and very much afraid lest they
should be returned to general service, which is
the punishment dealt out to all those whose conduct
in submarines does not justify their remaining
in them. They had all been through the same
early training, and most of them had joined submarines
since the war. Like the rest of the crew
they were good, steady workers, for the Submarine
Service can always have its picked men, and those
who are tried and found wanting are summarily
ejected to return to the rigours of ‘big-ship’
routine.</p>

<p>Occasionally an additional hand was carried
in the shape of a wireless or W.T. Operator, but,
as Raymond dabbled in wireless among other
things, he was not a permanent member of the
ship’s company, and spent most of his time in the
depot.</p>

<p>Captain Charteris took one keen glance along
the line of motionless figures, and turned to Raymond
and smiled.</p>

<p>‘All very smart, Raymond,’ he said in an undertone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>‘Yes, sir,’ replied the other, and Seagrave tingled
with delight as the two disappeared down the
engine-room hatch.</p>

<p>Arrived below, the Post Captain made a quick
and searching examination of the boat from end
to end. His eagle-eye seemed to be all-embracing.
A question to Raymond, an inquiry of the Chief
E.R.A., and a request that the main-line pump
should be started followed one another in the first
two minutes. It seemed that he made a very
cursory visit to the engine-room, but had anything
been seriously wrong Raymond felt sure that
Captain Charteris would have spotted it, and thanked
Heaven and the Chief E.R.A. that nothing was
amiss. Then for’ard through the length of the
boat, the Captain nodding his head as he listened
to Raymond’s explanations of some alterations
he had recently made, and occasionally asking a
question and always putting his finger on the weak
spot as if by instinct.</p>

<p>Presently they reached the tube-doors, and
Raymond heaved a sigh of relief. So far everything
had been satisfactory. The spare torpedoes were
examined, and a door was opened exposing the
long dark tunnel of the tube with its “fish” lying
snugly within, and then the Captain turned to
the firing-gear.</p>

<p>‘Where’s the cross connection on the firing line?’
he asked.</p>

<p>‘Done away with it, sir. It was all right if both
torpedoes were fired together, but the firing-tank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
took 40 seconds to re-charge, and if only one “fish”
were fired with the cross connection fitted it was
impossible to fire a second unless we waited for
that interval, because all the air was used on the
first one and there was nothing left to fire the
other with.’</p>

<p>The Captain nodded. ‘And now?’ he queried.</p>

<p>‘Each firing-tank fires the torpedo on its own
side of the boat, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Do you find it satisfactory?’</p>

<p>‘Very, sir.’</p>

<p>Captain Charteris turned away. ‘That’s all,
I think, Raymond,’ he said, and led the way up
the fore-hatch.</p>

<p>‘Ship’s company, ’shun!’ ordered Seagrave, as
the two officers passed down the line on their way
aft, the Captain quietly scanning the faces and
pausing now and again to ask a question as to
what boats a certain man had served in, when he
had received his medal ribbon, or how long he
had been in submarines.</p>

<p>At the gang-plank, where the coxswain was
waiting with his pipe ready, he issued judgment.
‘Not at all bad, Raymond,’ he said quietly. ‘I’m
coming aboard some day to see dummy shots
fired without the cross connection.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir,’ said Raymond saluting, and
Captain Charteris was piped over the side.</p>

<p>As he crossed from boat to boat the trilling of
the pipes was taken up by each coxswain in turn
as the crews came to attention and the officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
saluted, the boatswain’s mate at the <i>Parentis’s</i>
gangway bringing the performance to a triumphant
conclusion.</p>

<p>The quartermaster, the corporal of the watch,
messengers, and sideboys stiffened where they stood
as he crossed the deck and went down the starboard
gangway to inspect the remaining five
submarines.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later ‘pipe down,’
sounded by the juvenile Marine bugler, informed
all and sundry that the inspection was over. The
boats’ crews fell out, and such as were not
wanted for immediate duty trooped aboard the
depot and down to the crowded mess-decks, while
the officers remained comparing notes and discussing
the results of the ordeal.</p>

<p>‘What made the “owner” so ratty, Johnson?’
asked Raymond, on his way across to the <i>Parentis</i>.</p>

<p>The officer in question, who was captain of the
boat lying between Austin’s and Blake’s, shook
his head sadly, and then burst out laughing.</p>

<p>‘It’s all UP with Little Willy, I’m afraid, unless
he gets over it, which I very much doubt. And
everything was going so splendidly, too.’ He
sighed heavily.</p>

<p>‘What was it, you blighter?’ cried Austin.
‘He came aboard my packet in a state of fury, and
I had to do my dirty damndest to smooth things
over.’</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t my fault, George. I couldn’t foresee
it or I should have taken jolly good care to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
it. One of my stokers, whom I’m going to hang
to-morrow, by the way, is the proud possessor of
a monkey. I took particular care that the brute
should be sent inboard before the inspection, but
you know what those ruddy things are, and somehow
or other it must have sneaked aboard again.
It was hanging from a beam under the torpedo-hatch,
with part of an old ensign wrapped
round its head, and when the old man passed
underneath on his way for’ard, it dropped on his
shoulders.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘That’s all.’</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Monday morning dawned dull and dismal. A
steady downpour of thin drizzling rain that wet
through and chilled to the marrow did not tend
to brighten matters or relieve the gloom that had
settled on the coxswain as he surveyed the weather
with the eye of a fatalist. The hour of seven a.m.
does not tend to hilarity.</p>

<p>‘This ruddy weather,’ he remarked to the unemotional
landscape, ‘near drives me to drink.
Near drives me to drink, that’s wot it does.’</p>

<p>A cluster of sleepy-eyed figures clambering up
from the mess-decks caught his eye and gave him
the opportunity he had been waiting for.</p>

<p>‘Come along now. Step lively,’ he growled.
‘Six bells struck five minutes ago. Fall in ’ere
and tow a line.’</p>

<p>The half-dozen seamen and stokers, clad in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
overalls, put out their pipes and stumbled into
some semblance of a line as the remainder of
‘123’s’ crew appeared from their various lairs
and joined the unhappy company. The E.R.A.’s
carried on down to the boat to commence the
day’s labours, carefully picking their way between
the demons wielding brooms and the hose brandishers
who were performing the early morning task of
‘scrub decks.’</p>

<p>‘Show a little life now,’ snapped the coxswain
to his shivering subordinates. ‘Form two deep.
’Shun. Right dress. Eyes front. Stan’-at-ease.
Are ye all ’ere?’ he continued, checking off the
number on his fingers. ‘No, we’re one short.’</p>

<p>‘Jevons ain’t ’ere,’ volunteered the second
coxswain, inwardly cursing the able seamen who
kept him shivering in the rain.</p>

<p>‘I’m ’ere,’ cried a dishevelled figure hastily
taking its place at the end of the rear rank.</p>

<p>The coxswain surveyed him with a baleful
glance.</p>

<p>‘A little more from you, my lad, and you’ll be
spoke to. You turn out late once more an’ I takes
you before the first lieutenant. I’ve ’ad me eye
on you for some time.’</p>

<p>The seaman swallowed heavily. It was unwise
to argue with the coxswain in the still hours of the
morning. Also his roving eye caught sight of
Seagrave, who was coming forward clad in oilskins
and sea-boots and pulling on a long pair of engine-room
gloves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<p>‘T.’s crew, ’shun!’ cried the coxswain. ‘All
present, sir.’</p>

<p>Seagrave gravely returned the salute and began
telling off the men for their various tasks, an extra
pressure of work having necessitated an early
‘turn to.’</p>

<p>‘Stokers carry on with the chief E.R.A.; T.I.
and an S.T. on topping up and wiping down. The
water lighter’s alongside now and I’m coming down
to test the water, so don’t begin till I let you know.
We’ll charge afterwards. L.T.O. carry on with
the volt-metre board. Remainder clean ship.’</p>

<p>The coxswain saluted.</p>

<p>‘T.’s crew. Carry on down to the boat. Jevons,
you work with the T.I. Dismiss.’</p>

<p>The weary band broke away and trooped down
the ladder and across the boats to where ‘123’
lay on the outside of the tier. The coxswain
produced a key of large proportions, and, unlocking
the padlock on the conning-tower hatch,
disappeared below. Presently the other hatches
were opened from inside the boat, over which
canvas shelters were rigged to prevent the rain
from ruining her internal complexion, and the
day’s work commenced.</p>

<p>Overnight a long black lighter, filled with carboys
of distilled water, had been towed alongside and
made fast to the submarine, and now the tarpaulin
cover was hauled back and a long, flexible rubber
tube passed up out of the fore-hatch and its end
dropped into one of the carboys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Presently Seagrave appeared armed with a stick
of nitrate of silver with which he tested in turn
the contents of each of the water-holders. Two
of them were found wanting, for they clouded under
the operation, and were condemned as unfit for
use in the sensitive internals of a battery, and when
he had satisfied himself with the others he gave
the order to ‘carry on.’</p>

<p>With much labour the T.I. and Jevons filled
the tube with sterilised water and passed the free
end across to the boat and down the conning-tower
hatch, the S.T. firmly grasping its extremity
for fear of wetting the sacred brasswork. The
siphon thus formed was a labour-saver of a large
order and did away with the necessity of passing
the water below in buckets and perhaps rendering
it dirty in the process. Down below a sound of
rasping and hammering came from the engine-room
where the E.R.A.s and stokers were effecting
repairs, where there had been ‘a bit of a mess up
aft, sir,’ and could be seen wielding spanners and
lumps of waste in a masterly manner. The L.T.O.
was gravely attending to the volt-metre board,
whose vagaries had given trouble of late, and the
second coxswain was oiling the bearings of the
hydroplane and rudder shafts and generally making
himself useful. The remaining seamen were
cleaning brass as if their lives depended on it, a
state of things that was liable to undergo a slight
modification on Seagrave’s departure.</p>

<p>‘’Ere, Sam,’ called the T.I., ‘give us a ’and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
this deck-cloth,’ as that worthy paused on his
round to wipe an oily brow.</p>

<p>Together they rolled back the canvas carpet,
disclosing a solid rubber covering bolted to the
deck with iron battens, which on being raised
exposed a series of hatches beneath which was
the for’ard battery. One of these was then lifted
and the operation of ‘topping up’ began.</p>

<p>Every three weeks or so, owing to the constant
charging and discharging and other reasons, the
electrolyte in the cells, composed of sulphuric
acid and water, became used up and its level sank
in the cells, exposing the tops of the plates. These
were no toy cells either. They stood over four
feet high and were placed in the bottom of the
boat, below the deck level, in two long lines strapped
together with steel plates painted red and blue,
indicating positive and negative. The process of
topping up consisted of replenishing the water in
the cells until the level covered the plates, and
was usually accompanied by that of carefully
wiping and cleaning the inter-cell connections,
taking the densities, and generally seeing that all
was in order. An unhappy seaman, clad in oilskin,
was posted in the lighter to transfer his end of the
rubber tube to a fresh carboy as the first was
emptied and the work went merrily on. The T.I.
was the mainspring of the business, while the S.T.
worked under his orders, shifting the tube from
cell to cell as necessary, and generally doing as he
was told. He was there to learn and he knew it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
When two or three cells were finished, the hatch
was replaced and another lifted, and so on down
one line and up the other, by which time the
battery was completed, several carboys had been
emptied, and eight bells had struck aboard the
<i>Parentis</i>. ‘123,’ owing to a busy day, was carrying
out a special routine, and the crew trooped inboard
to breakfast.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased but the prospect was still
anything but cheery, and even the funny man
could not brighten the settled gloom that had
overcome the crew when work was restarted an
hour later. The T.I. and his satellites resumed
their labours by tackling the after-battery, and
casting much criticism on the health of the cells
and nature of the battery in general. The gun-layer,
assisted by the cook, overhauled his gun,
and the remainder continued their early morning
tasks with more or less signs of energy. It was
not a cheerful morning.</p>

<p>By-and-by Seagrave came down, having polished
off an excellent breakfast and feeling at peace
with the world, to examine the work in hand and
listen to the T.I.’s comments on his beloved
batteries.</p>

<p>Another hour saw the topping up completed,
and a waiting tug pounced on the water-lighter
and bore it away in triumph to its distant lair.</p>

<p>Boyd appeared just as the job was finished and
began to overhaul the gyro compass. While he
cleaned contractors and filed transmitters he burst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
into ragtime, which brought Seagrave aft with a
pained and virtuous expression on his face.</p>

<p>‘My God! Pilot,’ he said, ‘what a shine you’re
kicking up. If you’d been up since seven, like I
have, you wouldn’t feel so cheery. Who wouldn’t
be a navigator?’</p>

<p>‘Work with a will and sing while you work,’
said Boyd. ‘Work never killed the cat and I’m
going to put in quite half an hour at it to-day.
Our hard-worked submarine officers at their daily
toil.’</p>

<p>The Chief E.R.A., who was hovering in the
offing, chose his opportunity and plunged in.</p>

<p>‘Are you going to charge now, sir?’ he asked
Seagrave. ‘We’re all ready in the engine-room.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes,’ replied the ‘Sub.’ ‘We’ll have to
do a gas-engine charge, though. “147” has got
the berth at the charging pier. We’ll start with
500 in the series until the densities rise to twelve
twenty-five and then give her two-fifty in parallel.
Starboard Engine!’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir,’ and Hoskins disappeared into his
engine-room.</p>

<p>The L.T.O. made the grouper switch and then
started the starboard motor, and with the engine-clutch
in the Diesel was heaved over until she
fired and the engine got away by herself. The
process was much the same as cranking up a motor-car,
and as the revolutions increased the needle on
the ammeter, which had shown discharging at
first, worked slowly back, past zero and on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
charging, and, after a deal of flickering, finally
steadied at five hundred amperes.</p>

<p>The L.T.O. was to look after the charge under
Seagrave’s orders, and the T.I. and his minion
decamped to attend to the internals of a torpedo
that some one had been rude to.</p>

<p>Every hour Furness made the sounds of the
pilot-cells with a squeeze bulb—an instrument
rather like a fountain-pen filler—with which he
sucked up a small portion of the electrolyte and
was able to read the densities. Slowly they rose
until by noon, with the temperatures at about
50 deg. fahrenheit, the batteries stood at twelve
twenty-five and the charge was broken. The
sound of the engines died away and the L.T.O.
stopped the motor. Then over came the grouper-switch
to put the batteries in parallel, the motor
was re-started, and in less than a minute the charge
was under weigh again. The whole operation
was identical with that of starting the engines at
sea, the only difference being that the tail clutches
were out, so that the propeller was disconnected
from the shaft; also when the engines are propelling
the ship the motor-switches are broken
when once the Diesel is under weigh.</p>

<p>About three in the afternoon, when the entries
on the charging sheet began to look formidable,
and the charge was nearing completion, Raymond
came down to have a look-see, and satisfy himself
that all was in order. He and Seagrave conferred
for a few minutes on the ‘care and maintenance’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of secondary batteries, and then the skipper turned
to the voltmeter.</p>

<p>‘Voltage 2.5. Yes, that’s all right. Densities
1248 and 1250. Temperatures 80 deg. and 82 deg.
Um, yes. I think we’ll break the charge.’</p>

<p>‘Break the charge, Hoskins,’ said Seagrave,
waving towards the engine-room.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir,’ came the answer.</p>

<p>The engine stopped and the L.T.O. snipped the
switches over. In the engine-room the stokers
were bending over the silent Diesel, and Hoskins
began to square up the tools of his trade. For’ard
the T.I. and the redoubtable Jevons were replacing
their long-suffering torpedo in its tube, and the
coxswain, with puckered brow and the stump of
a pencil, was breathing heavily while he wrote up
the log. The brass rags were being packed up and
stowed away, the oil-cans replaced, and the hatches
closed. One by one the men foraged for their
caps and went up on deck. The T.I. began turning
the lights out. Work was over for the day. The
two officers were the last to go on deck, and then
the coxswain locked up the boat and followed in
the wake of his men. There were kippers for tea
in the Petty Officer’s mess, and he was late already.
It had been a trying and depressing day, and he
walked majestically abroad, feeling like the captain
who has made port at last when land had been
forgotten.</p>

<p>Raymond paused by the gun on his way to the
gang-plank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>‘Rotten little thing this,’ he said, pulling down
a lever and opening the breach. ‘Why the devil
they can’t give us something decent, I’d like to
know.’</p>

<p>‘We ought to have a twelve-pounder on an
anti-aircraft mounting,’ responded the ambitious
Seagrave. ‘A measley six-pound pea-shooter like
that isn’t any earthly use. It’s ages since we’ve
fired the thing, and it’ll probably jump the mounting
if we do. I can’t understand what they’re thinking
about, dumping that ruddy thing on us.’</p>

<p>Raymond smiled. The gun, quite handy and
useful in its own way, was Seagrave’s sore point
and afforded a never-failing bite.</p>

<p>‘We shall have to write and tell ’em so, but I’m
afraid they won’t take any notice of us. Six-pounders
you shall have, and six-pounders we
get, and they stick to us.</p>

<p>‘What I should really like would be a four-inch
and a few eggs,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> and mine-dropping gear. Then
we could do something. It’s sickening messing
about like this, looking for Fritz, who never comes
out, or runs as soon as he sees us. I’d like to see
one of their Battle Cruisers come across our patrol
one day. We’d show ’em.’</p>

<p>Raymond smiled again.</p>

<p>And so to tea.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The Officer of the Watch, one Meeks, Lieutenant
R.N.R., slowly paced the <i>Parentis’s</i> quarter-deck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
wrapped in the rig of the day, to wit, a heavy gloom.
The rain had ceased, but the sky was lowering
and overcast, and the wind had dropped some
hours ago. The moon, struggling gamely through
the clouds, was the only saving clause to the situation.
An unpleasant day had given place to a
damp and chilly night, and at 2.0 a.m. man is not
at his brightest.</p>

<p>Turning over in his mind the events of the day,
he recalled a long vista of disappointing circumstances.
At the outbreak of war, when the Reserves
had been called up, he had joined the colours
flushed with the thrill of patriotism that many
know so well. He had seen himself doing great
things, at least doing well, and perhaps ultimately
being turned over into the Active Service and
fulfilling a long cherished wish. However, after
concluding a gunnery course at Whale Island, and
making a good show in the examination, he had
been sent here as watch-keeper to a depot ship, a
parent ship to submarines. At first he had liked
the life, but the novelty of his surroundings soon
wore off, and he had longed to be at sea again,
where there was a chance of doing something. He
realised that watch-keepers in harbour ships were
necessary, but somehow had always imagined
that it wouldn’t fall to his lot to fill one of the
billets. Two years of war had found him in the
same ship, and to-day he had applied for a transfer
into one of the submarines as navigator. The results
had not been encouraging. The Captain had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
told him quite kindly that he felt hardly justified
in shifting him at present. He knew what that
meant. He hadn’t made a success of his work,
and was thought unfit for a boat. It was a bit
hard, he considered. He knew he didn’t take much
interest in his job, but found it difficult to do so
when he saw so many others of his kind going to
sea in boats and apparently doing well. If only
he could get a chance he felt sure he would do
well. But now....</p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and leant over the rail.</p>

<p>A side boy approached with a mug of steaming
cocoa, his bare feet making scarcely any sound
on the wooden deck.</p>

<p>‘Will you ’ave this now, sir?’ he queried.</p>

<p>‘Yes, please, put it on the table.’</p>

<p>He moved across the quarter-deck to the table
where lay the log and signal pads, and gazed heavily
at the dark blurs of the anchored Fleet. The
Corporal and Quartermaster of the Watch were
talking in undertones by the gangway. Then
five bells struck, and the sound was echoed from
the neighbouring ships and died away in the
distance.</p>

<p>The ship swung to the turn of the tide, and he
went up to the bridge and checked the position
by shore-bearings, keeping a good eye on the other
vessels to see that they would swing clear. Up
here a sleepy-eyed signalman and two signal-boys
were passing the time by restoring flags to the
lockers, and the night seemed very still and quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>Then a visit forward to the anchor watch and
back to the quarter-deck again, to continue the
slow pacing up and down to keep the cold out.
He glanced at his watch and yawned. Nearly
three o’clock. Only another hour of it. Up and
down the quarter-deck, up and down ... with
the knowledge that at any rate aboard each of
the darkened and silent vessels around him a
comrade in distress was performing the same
penance....</p>

<p>A pattering of bare feet from the direction of
the bridge, and a signal-boy appeared, breathless.</p>

<p>‘Red light showing from the Flagship, sir,’ he
reported.</p>

<p>Instantly the Lieutenant’s manner changed.
The regrets of yesterday had vanished. No need
for quiet now.</p>

<p>‘Quartermaster!’ he shouted. ‘Hands to aircraft
stations! Stand by funk-holes!’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir,’ came the cheery answer, followed
by the sound of a bugle and the shrill twittering
of the pipes.</p>

<p>‘’Aaaaands to—aircraft—stations!’ roared the
boatswains’ mates along the sleeping mess-decks.
‘Re—mai—ai—ai—nder stand byyy yer—funk-’oles!</p>

<p>The great ship turned over in her sleep, rubbed
her eyes, shook herself, and was awake. The sound
of sharp orders and scurrying feet told that men
were tumbling up from the mess-decks in all
states, dress and undress. Up on the lower bridge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Meeks was calling the Captain, who came out
wearing a bridge-coat and sea-boots over his
pyjamas, while a messenger was doing the same
service for the First Lieutenant.</p>

<p>The guns’ crews manned the anti-aircraft guns;
the fire-party fell in. Hoses were rigged and buckets
and sand collected, while those who had no special
duty to perform stood by their funk-holes in
accordance with orders. The duty coxswain was
shepherding the boats’ crews into their boats, the
officers appeared and took their stations, and with
much swearing, shouting, and bad language the
nine submarines pushed off from their parent
ship, to scatter and seek separate billets where
they would not provide such an easy mark to an
aerial intruder. The last boat was away with her
full complement, and the <i>Parentis’s</i> crew was at
stations. Ten minutes ago the ship had been
peacefully sleeping and the officer of the watch
ruminating over a wasted career.</p>

<p>A messenger climbed to the bridge and approached
the Captain.</p>

<p>‘From the First Lieutenant, sir,’ he said, saluting;
‘all boats away, sir, and ship’s company at aircraft
stations.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ replied the Captain absently,
scanning the heavens with his night-glass.</p>

<p>A pause—silence and expectancy, but the
silence of a multitude holding its breath or of
five hundred matlows trying to keep from cheering.</p>

<p>‘Lord,’ said the gun-layer of the six-pounder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
anti-aircraft, ‘where the ’ell is she anyhow? Any
of you blokes see ’er?’</p>

<p>‘There she is, Bill,’ cried the loader, pointing
with a grimy forefinger. ‘Between them clouds,
right a’ead there.’</p>

<p>‘That ain’t haircraft,’ sneered a voice, ‘that’s
a ruddy lump o’ smoke. That’s wot that is.’</p>

<p>‘Silence in the battery,’ snapped a voice out of
the darkness.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think it’s going to be anything serious,’
remarked the Captain to the Gunnery Lieutenant.
‘They’ve probably been reported down the coast,
but I doubt if they’ll approach us in here.’</p>

<p>‘Shouldn’t think so, sir. Hardly worth while
with so much high explosive knocking about.’</p>

<p>Away in the distance Raymond was handling
‘123’ like a veteran. Nine boats all shoving off
at the same time are apt to get in one another’s
way, and when semi-darkness is added matters
are not mended. Out of the tangle he made his
way, hurling an insult at a passing boat who was
talking about her tail in peevish tones, and steering
for the open water beyond.</p>

<p>‘Will you mind my tail?’ howled a raucous
voice. ‘Where the hell are you coming to. Put
her astern. Oh, damn!’ ... and the voice broke
off in incoherences as another dim shape appeared
across the bow, warbling about her planes and
calling curses on her telegraphs. ‘Go ahead, damn
you!’ yelled a voice; ‘are those telegraphs ringing
or are they not. Will you answer or——’ ‘Never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
mind, Willie.’ This from a cheery tenor. ‘Mother
likes the pattern. Shut up, you noisy blighter!’</p>

<p>‘123’ chuckled to herself as she freed from the
jamb, and five minutes later dropped her anchor
between two mammoth Battleships. All round
them whisperings and subdued voices rose, another
submarine passed astern, and the rattle of her
cable told that she too had found a billet. Only
a quarter of an hour ago and we were all asleep.
Raymond shivered and yawned miserably. ‘Damn
the war, anyway.’</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t seem to be anything,’ quoth Captain
Charteris to the ‘Guns.’ ‘I don’t think we shall
be worried to-night. Hallo!’</p>

<p>Boom! roared a gun from the shore battery.
Overhead the land searchlights sprang into being,
ten of them, from all parts of the horizon, centring
on one spot, and flickering over the heavens in
search of the invader.</p>

<p>‘Warning gun. Hands to funk-holes,’ said the
First Lieutenant.</p>

<p>Again the bugle and the roaring of the boatswains’
mates. ‘’Aaaands to—funk—’oles.’</p>

<p>Down below the men who had no particular
duty at aircraft stations, which is very different
to general quarters, dived down into their various
burrows, albeit much against their will.</p>

<p>A burly figure loomed out of the darkness.</p>

<p>‘Mess-decks cleared, sir. Hands in their funk-holes.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said the First Lieutenant. ‘Thank you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>The searchlights swept overhead, wavered a
little, and steadied over the land.</p>

<p>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat. Boom! Bang! Phit from
the land batteries down the coast. Still no sign
of the intruder to be seen from the Fleet. A whirr
and a rush of motors and a seaplane whizzed past,
soaring up and over on the look-out for the enemy.
Away to the south’ard others could be seen wheeling
and crossing high up in the glare of the searchlights.
Suddenly the roar of the shore batteries ceased.
Phit-phit-phit-phit came faintly in the distance
from the sea-planes, as the mitrailleuses were discharged
at the invisible foe.</p>

<p>Then, through a break in the clouds, into the
full glare of the searchlights, swung the majestic
Zeppelin. Calmly and sedately she floated,
apparently unmindful of the danger, though her
crew were working like madmen to get her out of
the perilous area. Away above her a tiny speck
was visible, wheeling and circling like a gull in a
gale of wind. A mighty flash and a roar showed
where the German had dropped a bomb over the
batteries, but still there was no order from the
Flagship, and the Fleet watched and waited in
silence. The shore guns had ceased firing now,
and up above rode that great airship as if despising
the puny craft who pitted themselves against
her.</p>

<p>Then ... a tiny flicker of flame was seen at
one end of the Zeppelin, licking and hissing round
the gas-bag as it spread from end to end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>‘’It, by God!’ yelled a Petty Officer in a strident
voice.</p>

<p>A sound of hoarse cheering broke from a ship
at the end of the line, was caught up and carried
down the harbour as ship after ship broke into one
wild roar of jubilation. The airship was crashing
down nose first, aflame from end to end. Like a
streak of blinding light she lit up the harbour,
the ships, and the upturned faces as she rushed
to her destruction. Down over the land she fell,
and the cheering swelled into a mighty roar as
she disappeared over the shoulder of a hill. Only
the sickly glare in the sky told where she was
burning to death, she ... and all she had contained.</p>

<p>As the yells of applause subsided, an answering
cheer was wafted from the batteries ashore, and
once more the Fleet burst into a thunder of appreciation.
Then from the Flagship high up a red light,
slowly winking and blinking in an urgent order,
and the sound wavered, died away, and finally
ceased altogether.</p>

<p>‘Flag-General, return stores, sir,’ said the First
Lieutenant to Captain Charteris.</p>

<p>The Captain nodded. ‘All right. Carry on,’
he said, and went back to his cabin as the vocalists
broke out into a long-drawn chant of: ‘Retur-ur-ur-n
Stor-or-or-es.’</p>

<p>Another rush of feet as boxes and branch-pipes
were replaced, buckets stowed away, and sandboxes
covered. The guns were secured and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
crews fell out, while the ammunition parties
returned the shell and cartridges and closed the
magazines.</p>

<p>The submarines had picked up the signal, too,
and hove in their cables with prayers of gratitude
that they might now continue their broken night’s
rest. One by one they came back out of the darkness
and dropped alongside the <i>Parentis</i>. A shape
would appear, dimly seen in the waning moonlight.
Somewhere a raucous voice would hail, and back
would come the answer, ‘123’ or ‘146,’ as the case
might be.</p>

<p>‘Answer’s “146,” sir,’ a voice would say, and
the hailing would continue until finally all boats
had returned and made fast in their accustomed
berths.</p>

<p>Overhead the purr of a high-power motor,
followed by another and another, told that the
seaplanes, their work completed, were returning
to their distant aerodrome, and another burst of
cheering greeted their appearance.</p>

<p>‘By God,’ said a bearded gun-layer, gazing after
them wistfully. ‘Lucky dogs, them blokes. See
all the scrappin’ like. And we didn’t ’ave a ruddy
shot. Not one, we didn’t.’</p>

<p>‘All boats returned and made fast alongside,
sir,’ reported the First Lieutenant, knocking at
the Captain’s door.</p>

<p>‘Pipe down, please,’ called Captain Charteris.
‘And good-night, Martin.’</p>

<p>‘Good-night, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>Then the voices broke out again as the men
fell out, and the boats’ crews came up over the
side. Down below they trooped in knots and
bunches until only the officers remained. For’ard
a gunner was encouraging a three-pounder whose
breach-block had turned peevish; on the quarter-deck
the boat captains were comparing notes of
their manœuvres and laughing over the experiences
of the night.</p>

<p>By-and-by they had all gone below and were
sitting in cabins, on each other’s bunks and tables,
talking at the top of their voices and laughing
over their misadventures.</p>

<p>The noise subsided and the lights went out in
cabins and mess-decks. Silence settled down once
more, and the ship was again in the possession of
the watch-keepers.</p>

<p>The moon had gone in and it was quite dark
by now, save for that yellow glare, gradually
fading and dying down, where the Zeppelin had
met her ghastly death.</p>

<p>The officer of the watch continued his pacing
up and down, and once more fell into a reflective
mood.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well. Life wasn’t so awful after all. Might
be worse. Those poor beggars in the airship must
have had a rotten two or three minutes. Perhaps
if I try again I may get a boat after all. The show
went off all right to-night. Skipper couldn’t
grumble, anyway. Think I’ll wait a month and
then have another shot.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>‘Five minutes to four. That’s one way of
passing a middle watch at any rate. Can’t reckon
on it every night, though.’</p>

<p>He yawned wearily and turned up the collar of
his coat.</p>

<p>Over the crest of the hill the glare of the dying
Zeppelin wavered a little, faded, flickered, and
went out.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Carruthers</span>, the Senior Submarine Officer and
Captain of ‘146’ entered the Mess with the stealthy
air of an assassin.</p>

<p>‘Show me that varlet, Raymond,’ he declaimed.
‘Produce him that I may mete out to him the full
measure of his punishments.’</p>

<p>‘What’s the row, James?’ asked a voice from
the depths of an arm-chair.</p>

<p>‘Ha, knave, thou dost flout me. Twelve long
years have I sought thee, and now ... aha!
The Captain desires speech with thee, even in his
own cabin.’</p>

<p>‘Good Heavens! Whatever’s up? Surely to
goodness he hasn’t got to know about my bumping
into Blake last night. I only scratched the paint,
and a bally wonder, too, considering the mess up of
boats there was.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what it is, my boy, at a price.’</p>

<p>‘No. I’m darned if you do. I’ll know all about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
it soon enough,’ replied Raymond, as he made for
the door.</p>

<p>‘Think twice, laddie, think twice,’ called
Carruthers after his retreating figure. ‘A time
will come when you will repent your harshness.’</p>

<p>As he knocked at the Captain’s door, Raymond
wondered what it was all about. He couldn’t
remember whether....</p>

<p>‘Come in,’ called a voice. ‘Oh, that you,
Raymond? Sit down. A telegram has just come
from the Senior Naval Officer at Darlton. He
says that the dry-dock will be vacant in a week’s
time for the space of a month, but if I don’t make
use of this opportunity he can’t guarantee it again
until September. It’s earlier than I intended, but as I
can’t afford to lose this chance I shall send you
down to get your re-fit over and done with, as
you’re next on turn. You’ll leave here at three
p.m. on Friday and arrive Saturday morning.’</p>

<p>‘Re-fit!’ Raymond showed his surprise in
spite of himself. A vista of living in hotels swam
before his eyes. A week’s leave during the summer,
a break in the monotony. Lots of work about a
re-fit, of course, but....</p>

<p>The Captain was still speaking.</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry I can’t give you longer notice, Raymond,
but I mustn’t let this opportunity slip.
You’ve got your defect list made out up to date,
of course.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. I’m all ready as far as that goes.
How long do they expect to take over it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>‘Well, as it’s your twelve-monthly re-fit, I expect
about five or six weeks. It all depends on whether
labour is to be had, of course. Nowadays one
never knows. That’s settled, then. Your escort
will be arranged for, and you’ll leave at three p.m.
on Friday unless I get any further orders.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir,’ said Raymond, rising, ‘and
thank you, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t thank me, Raymond. I wouldn’t let
you go if I could help it. Far too valuable these
hard times.’</p>

<p>The captain of ‘123’ closed the door quietly,
and two minutes later was back in the ward room.</p>

<p>‘Carruthers, you worm,’ he said reproachfully,
‘you knew it all the time. Now I’ve got to pay
you your price in any case, you usurious Jew.’</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ chipped in Austin. ‘Are you to
be keelhauled at dawn?’</p>

<p>‘No fear; re-fit.’</p>

<p>‘What!’</p>

<p>‘Re-fit. R-E-F-I-T. Re-fit.’</p>

<p>Austin sank back in his chair and mopped a
fevered brow.</p>

<p>‘He talks of re-fits,’ he babbled incoherently.
‘Here are we working our fingers to the bone and
running risks of hideous deaths daily, and the
stripling talks of re-fits.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I suppose he’s doing the decent anyway,’
said the practical Johnson, getting up and ringing
the bell.</p>

<p>‘I imagine I’ll have to,’ laughed Raymond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
‘hard as it is on the missus and the kids. See,
how many is it? Five, six, eight cocktails, please,
waiter.’</p>

<p>Carruthers raised his glass with elaborate
dignity.</p>

<p>‘I drink more in pity than in friendship to the
knave who refused his just recompense to the
bearer of glad tidings. In other words, here’s how.’</p>

<p>‘Cheer-oh, my little ray of sunshine,’ cried the
Torpedo Lieutenant. ‘What my most backward
pupil in the noble art of work will do when he is
torn from my tender care I tremble to contemplate,
but be of good heart. Bertie will await your return
to the fold and amply make up for the lost time,
Naughty, now,’ he added, ducking swiftly as a
chit-block sizzed over his head. ‘Remember me
to all the Hieland lasses and gae canny wi’ the
whuskey.’</p>

<p>‘You lucky bounder,’ said Austin. ‘Just imagine
it. I did my re-fit in the depths of winter and had
a positively loathsome leave. You’ll just come
in for the best time in the year.’</p>

<p>‘You might do a little commission for me on
your way down,’ put in the Staff Paymaster.
‘I’ve got a parcel I want taken home. Too big for
the post, and I live in Darlton.’</p>

<p>‘Me, too,’ said the Fleet Surgeon plaintively.
‘And it’s only such a little one.’</p>

<p>‘And get me some decent soft collars while
you’re down there,’ cried the Engineer Commander.
‘My wretched things are worn to shreds.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>‘Here, steady on now, you chaps,’ laughed
Raymond. ‘I’m not going till Friday. I’ll make
a list of all your wants and do my best.’</p>

<p>‘Well, if you will go back to civilisation in this
positively disgusting manner,’ said Carruthers,
‘you must expect the inevitable result. Hallo,
here’s Seagrave.’</p>

<p>‘Come in, my little man,’ cooed the Torpedo
Lieutenant gaily. ‘And Boyd, too; this is a
pleasure to be sure. Ring the bell nicely and ask
the pretty gentlemen what they’ll have.’</p>

<p>The new-comers blinked in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘What is it, sir?’ asked Seagrave. ‘It’s not my
birthday nor Boyd’s either, as far as I know.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, my boy; but you’re going down for a
re-fit. Just think of it and all it means.’</p>

<p>‘What! a re-fit. When?’</p>

<p>‘Friday next,’ said Raymond.</p>

<p>‘Good Heavens! what luck,’ cried Boyd. ‘My
brother home on leave, too. Good bally business.’</p>

<p>‘Talking about leave, my friend,’ persisted
Torps, ‘what are we all going to have?’</p>

<p>Seagrave rang the bell.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Aft, on the port side of the <i>Parentis</i>, was a cabin,
and in the cabin was a table. On the table was
a large pile of books, sheets of foolscap, and mysterious
forms labelled, S ‘134d,’ S ‘0196,’ etc. Close
to the table was a chair, and on the chair sat an
officer, with puckered brow and a fed-up expression
on his face. The face was Raymond’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>Enter Seagrave with a harassed look and a
further bundle of papers.</p>

<p>‘Well, what is it now?’ queried the seated one
wearily. ‘Oh, it’s you again, is it? Go ahead.’</p>

<p>‘Additions to the defect list. Only a few. And
I’ve brought the list of alterations at the same
time.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, have you; that’s cheery news. Great
Scott! Is this what you call a few? The list’s
a fathom long as it is. Here, let’s have a look.
Hydroplane gear to be overhauled; steering gear
overhauled and adjusted; new ventilator fans.
Any one would imagine the boat was dropping
to pieces. This is going to be “some” defect note,
let me tell you. The alteration list isn’t very huge,
however. Bridge enlarged, stanchions fitted, hum.
All tanks are down to be tested, of course, and air
bottles as well. Engines stripped. Hum. Give
me that pink sheet. And ahead we go on the
defect note. The alteration list I’ll let you copy
out if you’re good. Now, as to demand notes?’</p>

<p>‘The coxswain’s got all his made out, and Hoskins
is doing his lot now. Then there’ll be a good deal
of stuff on survey and demand. Flags, shackles,
looking-glass, clock, wire, and other things like
that. Then Boyd wants some “Sperry” spares,
and I think that’s the lot.’</p>

<p>‘And that’s a bit o’ luck,’ the Lieut.-Commander
said grimly, as Seagrave took himself off. ‘Thank
God for small mercies!’</p>

<p>As he himself put it, it was ‘some’ task. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
a submarine goes through her annual re-fit every
item in the boat from the ballast tanks and engines
to the knives and forks is taken out, if possible,
overhauled, tested, and replaced. Long lists have
to be prepared and signed or nothing can be done,
and woe betide he who gets on the wrong side of
the Naval Store Officer in the process.</p>

<p>Such things as awnings, flags, brooms, and other
permanent stores that are desired to be renewed,
must be entered on a mystic form printed in red
and known as a ‘survey’ note, and are filled in
also on a second form printed in funereal black,
which is called a ‘demand’ note or hope-you-may-get-it
chit. Should the state of the decayed articles
be sufficiently decrepit to satisfy the N.S.O.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> the
demand note is produced in triumph, and new
articles are issued and borne away as captives to
the boat by hoary-headed and deceiving matlows.</p>

<p>Such requisites as paint, rope, yarn, etc., which
are known as ‘consumable stores,’ need only be
filled in on the ‘demand’ note. But here again
the demander must be wary. A printed form is
issued to him stating clearly exactly to how much
of each commodity his class of vessel is entitled,
and an avenging fate overtakes the luckless wight
who demands, by accident or design, more than his
prescribed allowance. Should he escape these
pitfalls, another horror still rises to baulk him.
Articles under sub-head ‘A’ must not be named
on the same sheet as those under sub-heads ‘B,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
‘C,’ ‘D,’ ‘E,’ or ‘F,’ and every form must be
countersigned by the commanding officer to the effect
that he is not attempting to get more than his
due from rapacious Dockyard. Also the ‘reason
for demand’ must be given, either ‘to complete’
(Establishment) or ‘in lieu’ (of old worn out).</p>

<p>The coxswain needs paint, rope, oil, tar, flags,
bunting, awnings, yarn, spikes, and a host of other
things. The needs of the engine-room are enormous,
the electrical staff clamours for insulating tape,
lamp globes, fuses by dozens, and wire by the
hundred feet. The torpedo accessories raise up
their heads and gibber, and the batteries, the life
and soul of the boat, shriek to be cleaned and
washed and fed. But cold and incisive as the
voice of doom, ‘Articles under sub-head “A”
must not be named on the same sheet as these
under sub-head “B.”’ And, ‘Establishment list
for submarines “O” class.’</p>

<p>The defect note is finished at last and assumes
huge proportions. Pink and blushing as it well
may be, it begins with the lifting of the batteries
and the overhauling of the cells, wanders through
the stripping of the engines, the testing of the tanks,
and the dry-docking of the boat, and comes to
rest at last with the painting of the internal economy
and the re-fitting of certain shelves (they were
never there before) on which the captain wishes
to place his boots presumably, on his return to
sea.</p>

<p>The alteration list is a quick breath of hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
from a fervent heart yet sick with longing. But
here again Admiralty steps in and allows or not,
as the case may be, the placing of the wine locker
above or under the chest of drawers, as the case
may or may not be again. Won’t she want
painting by the time it’s all finished.</p>

<p>The ‘Demand’ notes are made out in triplicate
and signed to the bitter end. The ‘Survey and
Demand Notes’ are made out in quadruplicate,
but mercy of mercies, only one need be signed by
the long-suffering captain of the boat. The stacks
of paper rise, and rise, and blow away, and are
picked up and blow away again. But at last they are
finished, and thanks to them and the brains that
conceived them, when the submarine gets to work,
her re-fit will run like clockwork and no hitch will
occur despite the multiplicity and diversity of the
trades and workmen who will be employed upon
her. Youth scoffs in its ignorance at the filling
in of forms, but age and wisdom walk hand in
hand and bow to the minds that ordained these
things, having seen the results and gone away
... marvelling. For the results are good, and
good is good all the world over, and no man but
a sniveller can expect any better praise. But
Admiralty expects no praise at all, for she is very
old and very very wise, and knowing, winks one
eye and smiles.</p>

<p>So the maze of papers straightens itself out,
gives a shake, nears completion, and lo, the preparations
<em>are</em> completed. Three days gone, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
on the fourth ‘123’ can hurry down to Darlton,
with the assurance that whatever else happens
<em>her</em> re-fit will go smoothly enough. Nothing can
interfere with that, for her paper-work is complete
and all in order, and things will move.</p>

<p>No rush, no hurry, but a steady marching to
an appointed end. Small things, but the outcome
of hundreds of years of experience and waiting,
and the results have been, and are being, felt all
the world over.</p>

<p>As Raymond signed the last chit and sealed
the final envelope he heaved a sigh of relief. The
last form was filled and despatched and all was
ready for the morrow. The ward room made
merry over the event and several guests were
invited to dinner, among whom was Clinton, the
captain of H.M. Destroyer <i>Master</i>, who was to
escort ‘123’ down to Darlton.</p>

<p>After dinner the Destroyer man wandered down
to Raymond’s cabin and the two sat over their
charts discussing plans for the morrow.</p>

<p>‘Here we are,’ said Raymond, referring to his
orders. ‘We leave at 3.0 p.m. It’ll be dark by
then and we’ve got to anchor for the night. God
knows why. Get under weigh again at four in
the morning on Saturday, and arrive about four
in the afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that looks all right. What speed are you
going to do?’</p>

<p>‘Ten knots steady.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll do about twenty-two zig-zag and keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
ahead of you. You’ll have to steer a straight
course, I suppose.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and if we see anything I shall dive at
once. Don’t you worry about me. You probably
won’t be able to see me, but I shall look out for
myself and help you all I can if you have to put
up a scrap.’</p>

<p>‘All right. You’ve got a copy of the secret
signals for entering Darlton?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and they know we’re coming at every
signal station down the coast.’</p>

<p>‘No anchor lights, by the way.’</p>

<p>‘Rotten job this escorting business when it’s
a submarine. Every one suspects ’em, friend and
foe alike. I expect there are patrols about there
at night, and that’s why we’ve got to anchor.’</p>

<p>‘Expect so. Anyway it’s not very far, only
about 180 miles. How long are you stopping in
Darlton?’</p>

<p>‘I’m not. Got to return on Sunday. Rotten
job escorting anyway. Had quite a lot of it
lately. Hate it.’</p>

<p>‘Well, that’s all arranged for, and now—yes,
I think so,’ and together they returned to the
ward-room and rejoined the revellers.</p>

<p>The Engineering Commander was making a
speech.</p>

<p>‘——most auspicious occasion,’ he was saying
as they opened the door. ‘We are all heartily glad
that our young friends are leaving us.’ (Hear, hear.)
‘In fact, I dare venture to say that there is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
single dissentient voice.’ (Cries of ‘No, no.’) ‘But
a time will come when they will be seen once more
in our midst.’ (Question.) ‘Will be seen once
more in our midst, to the sorrow of the Hun and
delight of the Deputy Naval Store Officer down
at Darlton.’ (‘Yes, yes.’) ‘Do not despair; it
is not a British custom. We must hope for the
best. I trust you will all join me in speeding
the departing nuisance and drink damnation to
“123,”’ and the orator subsided amidst thunders of
applause.</p>

<p>The Torpedo Lieutenant rose, calm and dignified,
and eyed the members of the ward room with a
dissatisfied air.</p>

<p>‘Mr President, gentleman, and officers of “123.”’
(Roars of appreciation.) ‘It is with heartfelt
satisfaction that I rise on the occasion, or rather
to the occasion, of my young pupil’s departure.
We all know Raymond; he has been long amongst
us.’ (Loud and prolonged groans.) ‘We know
him well; we know his shortcomings.’ (‘We do,
we do.’) ‘It is my painful duty to inform you
that he is one my most backward pupils in the
art of work.’ (‘He is, he is.’) ‘Nevertheless he
is improving.’ (‘No, no.’) ‘Now, all my efforts
are like to be set at naught.’ (‘Yes, yes.’) ‘But
we must not give in.’ (‘Never.’) ‘We must back
one another up. We must coalesce; we must
unite; and on his return we must make a determined
and extended effort to save him from himself.’
(‘We will, we will.’) ‘We must stand back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
back. We must keep on hitting. In the words
of the immortal Captain Smith of <i>Titanic</i> fame,
we must “Be British.”’</p>

<p>Raymond rose to reply.</p>

<p>‘Mr President, Gentlemen, I hope and trust
that during my temporary absence you will conduct
yourselves as little like officers and as much
like gentlemen as you can, without causing yourselves
any great personal inconvenience. Glad
as I am to leave you, my heart bleeds when I try
to imagine your dilemma when bereft of my
restraining influence. You are a lot of rotters.’
(‘No, no.’) ‘You are a lot of rotters, to whom I
wish bad weather and flat beer, and don’t forget
that if you increase with your motors in series,
you increase on the one you haven’t increased
on before you increase on the one that you
have. Think it out well and dream about it. I
will endeavour to execute your commissions.’
(‘Hear, hear, hear.’) ‘Little as I wish to.’ (‘Oh,
oh.’) ‘With the greatest pleasure in the world
we part brass rags at 3.0 p.m. to-morrow.’
(Cheers.)</p>

<p>Then the ward room broke loose, and an obstacle
race was organised, much to the detriment of the
furniture, and after Blake had given a juggling
turn the visitors were called on for a side-show.</p>

<p>After much whispering and preparation, during
which time the whisky was circulated, it materialised
in the form of a charade in which a Jew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
organ-grinder, a beauteous damsel, and a gentleman
with a green nose were the leading lights.</p>

<p>Then Hackensmidt and Madrali (Carruthers and
Johnson) wrestled for the world’s championship
of ‘caught-as-caught-couldn’t’ wrestling, the result
of which was that a gasping Johnson lay on the
flat of his back, knocking feebly on the deck, what
time an empurpled Carruthers kneaded him in
the chest. Visitors and hosts alike arose and fell
on them.</p>

<p>The rugger scrum which ensued was a huge
success, though the ball (somebody’s Nautical
Tables) suffered rather in the process. Then the
piano got going, and as eleven o’clock struck came
the chorus <span class="locked">of:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘A German officer crossed the Rhine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Skibye, Skiboo!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">hammered out by the lungs of the united ward room.</p>

<p>Then the party broke up and the visitors departed.
Farewells and ‘good lucks’ were exchanged,
and the ward room servants locked up the darkened
quarters. ‘123’ was off to-morrow, and her captain
was rather popular.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>At three p.m. the following afternoon H.M.S.
<i>Master</i> hoisted the signal ‘M.K.,’ requesting from
the Flag permission to proceed in execution of
previous orders. Hardly had the flags reached
the yard-arm when an answering splash of colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
(red with a white cross) rewarded the efforts of
the hawk-eyed signalman.</p>

<p>‘Signal affirmed, sir,’ he reported, and as the
<i>Master’s</i> anchor came up into the pipe the Church
Pennant fluttered to the deck, and, turning on her
heel with a white threshing of water, she came
ahead and made for the harbour entrance.</p>

<p>Behind her was ‘123,’ who had left the <i>Parentis’s</i>
side some ten minutes before. Her Diesels had
just started, and the oily smoke of the exhaust
was thinning away astern as she fell into line
behind her escort. She was on passage now, and
her routine was rather different from that of the
regular patrol work. On the bridge were Raymond,
Boyd, the coxswain, and the look-out.
By-and-by when clear of the land the officers could
take regular watches and drop into the order of
ordinary surface ships.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she was in diving trim, and only
needed to flood main ballast to take her under in
case of necessity. Down below she looked like a
veritable warehouse. Most of the officers’ luggage
was going down in the escort, but bags and portmanteaux
that were likely to be needed <i lang="fr">en route</i>,
or immediately on arrival, were stowed below,
and the crew’s bags and hammocks were piled up
in the fore-end, a mighty heap of belongings which
had had to be compensated for when trimming
the boat for diving.</p>

<p>As they steamed out of the harbour, the submarine
and her greatest enemy, there were many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
envious glances cast at the boat that was going
down for her re-fit. ‘Lucky dogs,’ quoth a watch-keeper
in a battleship, as they cleared her
counter.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> ‘Re-fit and leave. I haven’t had any
for years.’</p>

<p>Outside the harbour and clear of the defences
Boyd put her on her southerly course, and the log
was streamed. Not a log that tows astern like
that of a surface ship, but a long cylindrical tube
carrying vanes at its lower end, which is lowered
through a hole in the bottom of the boat and
packed to prevent leakage. The Destroyer shot
ahead at her twenty knots (it was nothing to her,
as she was one of the latest class, and capable of
a good deal more) and began her zig-zag.</p>

<p>‘123’ had perforce to keep a straight course,
while the <i>Master</i> steamed about a mile ahead of
her and dashed across the bows in her efforts to
reduce her twenty knots to ten.</p>

<p>She was doing a twelve points zig-zag now, six
points to starboard of the course and then six
points to port, while ‘123’ ambled along behind
at her steady ten straight. It was a good illustration
of the hare and the tortoise, though if you
had told Raymond so he would have brained you
on the spot.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the captain went below, and he
and Seagrave had tea behind the green curtains
and discussed the coming prospects of re-fit. So
far the weather was beautiful and the sea like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
mill-pond, and after the meal Seagrave got a deck-chair
up the fore-hatch and sat on the superstructure
with a magazine. Raymond was dozing
down below, in spite of the strains of a wheezy
accordion that came from the region of the engine-room,
and Boyd, the helmsman, and the look-out
were in charge of the bridge. Most of the crew
who were off were sleeping too. This was a passage,
not a business patrol, and though they were prepared
if anything should arise they were not
looking for trouble this time. The Destroyer
continued her erratic dashings across the bow,
men came up for a smoke or to point out landmarks
on the coast to one another, and dinner-time
came and went. About half-past eight a distant
smudge of smoke took shape and hardened in the
form of an armed trawler who bore down upon
them, fussily belligerent. <i>Master</i> stopped her
gyrations and took steady station ahead, her yardarms
eloquent of her consort’s right to exist. But
the trawler was persistent, and closed them with her
6 pounder manned and every beam in her creaking
with suspicion. She challenged, was answered,
still held on, and then sullenly turned on her heel,
a disappointed and disgusted trawler. Then <i>Master</i>
drew ahead again, and as ‘123’ went by a boy in
the trawler waved his cap and shouted something.
The sun set and twilight gave way to darkness.
The point of land ahead gathered itself out of the
mist, and a small light showed from the Destroyer’s
stern. Then she steadied ahead on a straight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
course again until just before ten o’clock, when
she put her helm a-starboard.</p>

<p>Raymond put his telegraph over and the
‘Klaxons’ hooted below.</p>

<p>‘Stop both,’ he said. ‘Not bad; just about
reached Hunter’s Point by ten o’clock. Stand
by the weight. Group down.’</p>

<p>‘Both engine-clutches out, sir,’ came the messenger’s
voice up the hatch.</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay. Astern both.’</p>

<p>A rattle from ahead told that the Destroyer
had picked up her moorings, and a moment
later Raymond gave the order: ‘Stop both. Let
go.’</p>

<p>A whirring of wire followed as the weight was
released, and then the messenger’s voice rose
again.</p>

<p>‘Took bottom in 12 fathoms, sir.’</p>

<p>‘All right. Veer out to 36 fathoms.’</p>

<p>‘Thirty-six fathoms, sir. Brought up.’</p>

<p>Seagrave reappeared from the depths, and took
on the anchor watch. He and the look-out were
to remain on till midnight, when Boyd and another
seaman would relieve them.</p>

<p>‘Have you started a charge yet?’ asked Raymond,
as he prepared to go below.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. 600 in parallel.’</p>

<p>‘That’ll do. Tell Boyd we’re getting under
weigh at four o’clock, and if you see anything,
she’s all ready for diving. Let me know at once,
but if anything starts firing or stunting about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
dive at once on the weight, and we’ll cut the wire
when we get down.’</p>

<p>‘Very good, sir. Good-night,’ and Seagrave
was left to his own devices.</p>

<p>A dark night and a dead calm sea. Half a mile
to the southward a black smudge showed where
the Destroyer was anchored and the western
horizon was filled with the low coast-line about
three miles distant. Then the moon rose and a
vigilant look-out was necessary in case any enemy
raiders were on the prowl. Very still and silent,
save for the lapping of the water round the pressure
hull and the sound of the engines and the battery-fans
that told that the charge was under weigh.
Otherwise the boat was ready for diving. Her
hatches were closed save for the conning-tower,
and the compass-lid screwed down. The gyro
repeater had been sent below and all unnecessary
gear stowed away.</p>

<p>The two vessels swung to their anchors, and the
moon climbed higher and higher, changing from
red to orange and orange to silver as it cleared the
mists of the horizon. Midnight came at last, and
with it came Boyd who was to keep the middle
watch.</p>

<p>‘Here we are, pilot,’ said Seagrave. ‘Pleased
to see you. The lead’s over aft. The <i>Master’s</i>
half a mile or so off bearing about 185 deg., and
we’re ready for diving except for the charge.
Skipper wants to be called to get under weigh at
four o’clock. Let him know if you see anything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and dive on the weight if necessary. Got the
challenge and reply? Right then, that’s the lot.
Cheer-oh.’</p>

<p>And he disappeared below to hot cocoa and
Morpheus.</p>

<p>The look-out was relieved, and the vigil continued.
The little bridge was a weary place when
‘123’ was not under weigh, and time passed very
slowly. Boyd yawned miserably and climbed
down on to the superstructure, as it was calm
enough to walk there without running the risk of
falling overboard.</p>

<p>But even here it wasn’t all it might be. One hit
one’s head on the jumping wires and stumbled
over the closed after-hatch, and after a while he
returned to the bridge and the cold comfort of
the little stool screwed into the deck. The look-out
was on the other side, leaning up against the
standard. He also was wishing the night would
pass and they could get on down to Darlton. Three
o’clock; not so very much longer....</p>

<p>And then suddenly they were both on the alert,
staring out to starboard where something was
showing on the northern horizon.</p>

<p>‘Call the Captain,’ shouted Boyd down the
hatch. ‘Break the charge and shut off for diving.
In tail-clutch and close battery ventilators.
Diving stations.’</p>

<p>In a moment the crew were awake and Raymond
on the bridge rubbing his eyes and peering out
at the intruder. The Destroyer had seen her also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
and her cable was coming in hand over fist. The
sound of the engines died away, and a voice came
up the hatch reporting that they were ‘shut off
for diving and tail-clutch in, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Flood 1,’ replied Raymond. ‘Stand by 2 and
3. Heave in the weight.’</p>

<p>‘Open No. 1 Kingston and No. 1 main vent,’
came Seagrave’s voice. Then, ‘1 full, sir.’</p>

<p>‘All right. Stand by to dive.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t think it’s much after all, sir,’ said Boyd.
‘Looks rather like a tramp.’</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a tramp. An Admiralty collier on her
way south for a fresh cargo of black diamonds,
and Raymond cursed his unlucky star that had
brought him out in the middle of the night for
nothing.</p>

<p>‘’Vast heaving the weight,’ he cried. ‘Blow 1.
Fall out diving stations.’</p>

<p>The tramp waddled by without seeing them
(they were a very small mark even in the moonlight),
and never knew the excitement she had caused,
but her ears must have burned nevertheless.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think we need start the charge again,’
Raymond told the ‘Sub’ when he got below once
more. ‘We’ll be getting under weigh in another
hour.’</p>

<p>And so the remainder of the watch passed
peacefully, and at four o’clock Raymond was up
once more and the weight anchor was hove in.</p>

<p>The Destroyer was awake also, and her cable
brought up the dripping anchor as ‘123’ was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
getting her engines ready. The compass was
brought up and everything prepared, and then
the <i>Master’s</i> screw began to revolve and she swung
round to her course.</p>

<p>Raymond leant down the hatch.</p>

<p>‘Engines 300 revs.,’ he shouted.</p>

<p>‘Three ’undrest, sir,’ floated up from below,
and then away came the Diesels and a cloud of
petrol-filled exhaust swept over the bridge. ‘123’
gathered speed, and the vapour thinned away as
Boyd steadied her on her course. Then <i>Master</i>
drew ahead and began her zig-zag. A break of a
few hours and they were off again on their way
to Darlton, the present goal of the ‘ship’s company’s’
desires.</p>

<p>The dawn was struggling over the eastern sky
and away to starboard the land was showing up
through the shadows. With the sunrise came a
cloud of trawlers, who hovered round until
absolutely certain of the submarine’s bona fides,
and then fell away and pursued their lawful business
of Hun hunting. Farther south a patrol of three
Destroyers came up over the horizon, swept them
with a searching glance, and hurried on over the
earth’s shoulder, following their patrol-track as
a sentry does his beat. After breakfast they fell
in with a supply-ship on her way to the Fleet,
and later on passed a coastwise cargo-boat, who
turned on heel and ran till convinced by the <i>Master</i>
that ‘123’ was not a ‘U’ boat.</p>

<p>And so the day wore on, and the funny man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
cracked jokes and the signalman played a mandoline
in the after-compartment, and towards three o’clock
in the afternoon the smoke of Darlton was visible
down the coast.</p>

<p>The <i>Master</i> slackened her speed and kept closer
to her charge, her signal halliards bristling with
replies to challenges and evidences of her innocent
intentions, but the outer patrols who came out
to meet them still treated them as unwelcome
guests, until something the Destroyer said seemed
to satisfy the senior ship, and the group of trawlers
fell away and <i>Master</i> and her consort were allowed
to pass on without further interruption.</p>

<p>The inside trawlers gave way to them, and the
boom was lowered in answer to their request, and
then the Destroyer at the gate woke up to the
fact that strangers were entering, and sprang to
life waving her semaphore and generally ‘doing
things.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Master</i> to proceed to No. 4 and 5 buoys,’ she
ordered. ‘“123” to proceed to inner harbour
and make fast to quay opposite No. 2 Store.’</p>

<p>The escort swung away to her moorings, and
‘123’ held on to the inner harbour, where a crowd
of dockyard labourers was gathered to see her
pass. Raymond dropped her alongside and tied
her up. Then he sent for Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to report my arrival to the S.N.O.,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>’
he told him. ‘You’d better make arrangements
for the crew’s accommodation in the submarine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
barracks. There’s one in the dockyard somewhere.
Boyd can get our luggage off the escort and take
the lot up to the Royal Hotel. We’ll have to live
there while we’re here. See everything squared
up. I’ll be back as soon as I can, but I don’t
suppose we’ll dry dock till next week.’</p>

<p>A red-haired lad on the quay turned to a dock-side
loafer as he pointed at the <span class="locked">boat,—</span></p>

<p>‘Is yon what you ca’ a soobmarine?’ he inquired.</p>

<p>‘Ay, yon’s it.’</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Sunday, the day of rest, was by no means restful
for ‘123.’ A deluge of visitors poured into the
boat, starting with the Chief Constructor and
Engineer Commander of the Dockyard, and ending
with foremen fitters and boilermakers and electricians.
All these gentlemen appeared with
lengthy lists and copies of the defect notes, and
most of them, most certainly the Commander
and the Constructor, seemed to be under the fixed
impression that the boat was captained by a
demon in disguise who was doing his dirty damnedest
to get more done to her than was her just allowance.
Visits to the S.N.O. and Naval Store Officer took
place early in the day, and by noon the battery
boards had been lifted by a host of workmen, and
the great cells were coming out, dangling on the
ends of tackles, to be gently lowered on to trucks
and wheeled away to the battery sheds. Later
in the afternoon a small army attacked the engine-room
and began stripping the engines, while Hoskins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
and his merry men danced attendance and shed
salt tears of sorrow.</p>

<p>The first few days were bound to be strenuous.
The torpedoes, gun, and ammunition were all
taken away and stowed in sheds and magazines,
and another group of workmen got to work on
the superstructure, lifting the condemned plates
and generally making havoc and noise in the
process.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the crew were accommodated in
the Naval Barracks, whence they were shepherded
to work each morning by the coxswain, and the
officers lived in hotels in the town. There was
no thought of leave just yet, as there was too much
work to do, and on Monday morning the boat was
placed in dry dock.</p>

<p>As the water descended in the dock her underwater
lines became visible, and one was struck
with their resemblance to the shape of a fish. The
tail, the fins, the head, all were there, and the holes
in the bow-cap looked like the two great goggle
eyes of an underwater monster.</p>

<p>The re-fit was now in full swing. Both batteries
were out in the sheds, and Seagrave spent every
spare minute he had in hovering over the cells
and expostulating with the electrical experts who
were to overhaul them. Meanwhile Raymond
would be in the boat or visiting the powers that
be, and Boyd was usually to be found in the
vicinity of the office of that mighty man, the Naval
Store Officer, for the greater part of the day. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
was not much for the crew to do. The engine-room
staff were helping the workmen in their
department, and the electrical experts were busy
also, but the ordinary rank and file were employed
mostly in chipping paint and rust and cleaning
up messes made by the busier members of the
staff.</p>

<p>At the end of the first week the engines were
practically ashore, the after superstructure had
also been lifted, and the exhaust pipes removed.
Both batteries were out and all the air bottles had
gone ashore to be tested. Stages had been rigged
round the boat, and men were working on the
bow-cap, which was to be lowered and overhauled,
and also on the rudders and hydroplanes which
were being stripped down, rebushed, and generally
attended to.</p>

<p>The boat was in a state of ordered chaos by
now, and it was almost impossible to move in her
below. Men seemed to be everywhere, all round
her and underneath her even, for the Kingston
valves in the bottom of the boat were being seen
to and tested among other things. She lay in the
dry dock like a landed salmon, hammered at and
struck by merciless and persisting workmen who
seemed to delight in tearing things to pieces. The
main motors were already receiving their due
modicum of attention, much to the distraction
of the T.I., who spent most of his day in the torpedo
shed.</p>

<p>Finally, after about ten days of it, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
ballast tanks had been cleaned out and painted
(you had to crawl in through a tiny manhole to
get to them), the time for testing arrived, and
Seagrave was allowed to depart on his well-earned
leave. The tanks were tested separately by a
water pressure, water being pumped in and left
at the required pressure for a stated interval.
Then the tank was drained and opened up, and
Raymond and Hoskins, who was a man in great
demand just now, would crawl in clad in overalls
and see that all was in order. The main ballast
tank, the trimming tanks, auxiliary and buoyancy
tanks, were all tested in this way, and even the
fuel tanks had to go through the same ordeal,
though of a much less severe character. By the
time these tests were all satisfactorily finished,
the re-fit was in its third week, and matters were
at their height. The battery tanks had been cleaned
out and were now being ‘rosmanited,’ or covered
with a preparation that resists the action of the
acid, if any should be spilt out of the cells. The
bow-cap had been down and replaced, and the
rudders and hydroplanes were once more in position
by the time Seagrave returned from his ten days’
leave and Boyd was able to go away for his spell.
Raymond, poor wight, would be lucky if he could
snatch a couple of days just at the end of the
performance.</p>

<p>The air bottles underwent their ordeal and
were replaced singly, a matter of much labour,
and the engines began to return in pieces and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
shape and resemble their accustomed appearance.
The bigger jobs were over, and the boat was painted
inside and out, and left the dry dock after being a
month out of the water. Then the battery began
to come back, and the cells were strapped together
and the boards laid down, and the internal appearance
of the boat looked a little more ship-shape.
But there was still a host of minor things to be
done. Motors and rheostats were ashore, and had
to be replaced and wired, alterations were being
made to the bridge, and the superstructure was
not yet in place. Presently Boyd returned from
leave, and Raymond made a dash to London only
to be recalled three days later over a matter of an
alteration to the H.P. air line. The stores began
to drift aboard and the boat to look a little more
like her old self, for they were speeding things up
now owing to urgent telegrams of recall to the
<i>Parentis</i>, and every one was working at fever heat.</p>

<p>The last stages were reached, however, when
the painting party arrived to beautify ‘123’s’
internals with white enamel, what time the carpenters
were putting up those shelves (on which
one would imagine the captain wanted to place
his boots) and shifting the wine locker from above
to below the chest of drawers.</p>

<p>However, the messes were clearing up and the
time of turmoil nearly at an end; most of the crew
had had a few days’ leave and the re-fit had been
satisfactory.</p>

<p>At the end of five weeks the boat was finished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
and nothing remained but to take in fuel, torpedoes,
gun, and ammunition, and carry out the final engine
and diving tests before returning to the welcoming
bosom of the <i>Parentis</i>.</p>

<p>A copy of the programme to be carried out in
the way of tests was submitted to, and approved
by, the Senior Naval Officer, and the boat took
in her fuel and war machines without further
delay. On the morrow the engine trials were to
take place, and the ship’s company paused and
drew breath before the final struggle.</p>

<p>At an early hour the following morning Seagrave
left the hotel <i lang="fr">en route</i> for the dockyard, and by
eight o’clock ‘123’ had been tied up to the quay-wall
as if she were never intended to leave the all-embracing
docks of Darlton. The Engineer Commander
and Raymond put in an appearance by
the time all was ready, and the worthy Hoskins
and his staff were very much in evidence. A final
inspection and polish up were made, and then the
motors were started and the engine clutches forced
home.</p>

<p>There was the usual fizz and bump as the exhausts
coughed out the initial clouds of white smoke and
the explosions became quicker and quicker. The
port engine got well away, but after a manful effort
the chugging of the starboard Diesel wavered and
dragged and stopped altogether. ‘123’ had surged
forward when the screws began to revolve, and was
tugging at her mooring ropes like a terrier on a
lead, in spite of the fact that only half her power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
was under weigh. But the ropes held her, and
presently Hoskins’s face appeared up the engine-room
hatch shouting an explanation through the
din made by the well-behaved port engine. After
a couple of false starts, during which time the
Engineer Commander and the E.R.A. gravely
combated over her behaviour (blood brothers for the
moment), the trouble was rectified, and the defaulter
made good her character. Full speed was slowly
worked up to, and the boat lay to the quay with her
propellers turning at many revolutions a minute.</p>

<p>Presently the Commander took himself off, and
even Raymond was satisfied when the worthy
Hoskins, who held in great scorn all dockyard
work, pronounced that ‘though they ’aven’t done
wot they ought to ’ave, wot they ’ave done ain’t
bad.’</p>

<p>The test took the greater part of the day, and it
was arranged that the diving trial should take
place on the morrow. This would be the supreme
test, when all the work of the re-fit would be put
to the proof, and several of the dockyard officers
and contractors’ people were to come down in the
boat to see it carried out. Raymond was rather
pleased about it, although he hated passengers,
for, as he put it himself: ‘It brings it home to
those beggars far more if they’re in the boat when
anything goes wrong than if we just come in and
tell ’em about it afterwards.’</p>

<p>And so the next day the diving trials took place.
The passengers were aboard ten minutes before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the scheduled time for leaving, and as the hour
struck, ‘123’ pushed off from the quay and steered
out of the harbour, at the entrance to which she
was met by a trawler flying a large red flag, who
was to warn all outside traffic of the presence of
a submarine.</p>

<p>As a large number of alterations and additions
had been effected which were liable to alter her
trim, the tanks were all empty, with the exception
of the fuel tanks, and she was to do a standing
trim in shallow water. That is, she was to remain
stopped, flood her main ballast, and then very
gingerly admit the necessary extra water to take
her down.</p>

<p>Three miles outside the harbour she brought
up in the appointed spot and came to a standstill,
the passengers were hurried below, and the order
given for ‘diving stations.’ Then Boyd and the
coxswain climbed down the conning-tower hatch,
followed by Raymond, who, after closing the lid,
opened one of the scuttle guards and remained
up in the tower. From here he could see through
the thick glass the trim of the boat and the manner
in which she was taking the water. Boyd was at
the periscope, and Seagrave was wandering all
over the boat, superintending and seeing that all
was in readiness. The dockyard people, most of
whom had not been down in a submarine before,
‘stood round,’ looking rather foolish. They were
beginning to realise that their lives were in the
hands of the Lieut.-Commander they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
wont to beard in their own fastnesses, and a sense
of proportion was slowly dawning within them.
The crew were at their ordinary diving stations,
and Seagrave reported ‘All ready, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Flood 1 and 4,’ said Raymond, and over came
the Kingston levers, and as the vents were opened
the water could be heard gurgling into the tanks.
2 and 3 were flooded in the same manner, and the
boat was in main ballast trim. Then the trimming
tanks were partially filled, and as the buoyancy
flooded the boat began to have a tender feeling
as if she were on the tremble, and the water began
lapping into the superstructure overhead as she
settled down.</p>

<p>‘How is she?’ asked the captain.</p>

<p>‘Two degrees by the stern, sir,’ replied the
coxswain.</p>

<p>‘Another 500 in the fore, then,’ and five hundred
gallons more were admitted, when the coxswain
reported ‘Horizontal, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Right. Eleven thousand in the auxiliary.’</p>

<p>The auxiliary vent was opened while a stoker
hauled back the Kingston, and Seagrave watched
the gauge as the level crept up in the glass tube.
Presently he gave an order, and the lever was
snapped back into position.</p>

<p>‘Eleven thousand, sir.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ came Raymond’s voice from the
conning-tower. ‘Is she showing anything on the
depth-gauge?’</p>

<p>‘Three feet, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>‘Give her another five hundred.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boyd at the periscope was keeping
a careful look out for approaching craft. A collier
in her way in came perilously close, but the watchful
trawler headed her off and led her out of harm’s
way. As the tanks flooded his sky view became
less and less; as the instrument was fully hoisted
he could guess she was settling down before the
gauge began to register.</p>

<p>Finally, Raymond came down from the control
room to see that all was as it should be.</p>

<p>‘She’ll do now,’ he explained to the passengers.
‘She’s got all the ballast she wants, and only needs
a touch to take her down. We’re like a bottle
half-full of water—just on the bob, as it were.’
Another look round and then: ‘Start the motors,’
he added ‘Full fields. Take her down gently.’</p>

<p>The boat gave a slight shudder, and the sound
of the water could be heard lapping past her as
she gathered weigh. The coxswains spun their
wheels, eyes on the gauge, and gradually she crept
down to thirty feet.</p>

<p>‘Hold her at that,’ said Raymond, and then he
and Seagrave and the dockyard experts made a
tour of the boat, while Boyd lowered the periscope
and kept an eye on the helmsman to see that he
was on his course. The inspection proved satisfactory
(it was a lengthy business), and the party
returned to the control room, and Raymond ordered
the motors to be stopped and the boat was brought
up to 18 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>‘All clear, Boyd?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘All clear, sir. The trawler’s just astern.’</p>

<p>‘Right. Group up. Thirty feet.’</p>

<p>‘Grouped up, sir,’ from Furness, as the grouper-switch
came over with a bang and the motors got
away in earnest.</p>

<p>The boat was doing a good eight knots now,
and could be felt vibrating through the water as
the speed increased. All eyes were on the gauges,
the coxswains watching their depths and the
L.T.O.s their ammeters as Raymond increased
to 800 amperes. Then once more the motors were
stopped and the batteries placed in parallel or
‘grouped down,’ and then came the <span class="locked">order,—</span></p>

<p>‘Eighty feet.’</p>

<p>As the hydroplane and diving rudder wheels
went over, the visitors’ expressions became a little
tense and anxious. One of them laughed and
cracked a stale joke, another fidgeted with a bunch
of keys, but nobody said anything.</p>

<p>That sense of proportion was developing.</p>

<p>The depth needle crept up to the requisite depth
and steadied, and then another tour of inspection
took place, for leaks this time, and was also pronounced
satisfactory. The visitors breathed again,
but thoughts of the fresh air and sunlight up above
<em>would</em> obtrude themselves nevertheless. It seemed
so still and quiet, and the electric light glared and
winked on the brass work while up above....</p>

<p>‘A hundred feet.’</p>

<p>Somebody coughed nervously (it was <em>not</em> one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
of the crew) and the boat continued her descent.
At the hundred foot level she steadied and the
final inspection was made, and to the great relief
of certain members of the passengers, who were
thinking about that pressure of 45 lb. to the
square inch, the boat rose to thirty feet, the motors
were stopped, and Raymond gave the <span class="locked">order,—</span></p>

<p>‘Blow 1, 2, and 3.’</p>

<p>The Kingstons were opened, and Hoskins on
the air-manifold got the air in group working, the
depth needle hurried back to zero, and Raymond
clambered up the conning-tower and threw open
the hatch.</p>

<p>‘One,’ he shouted, ‘two, three,’ as the tanks
emptied, and then the burly coxswain pushed his
way up and took the helm, followed by Boyd and
the much-relieved dockyard potentates.</p>

<p>A bell rang below and the engines were started
up. The protecting trawler bore down on them,
and they were off for the harbour at ten good
knots an hour. No fuss, no noise, but the visitors
were thinking and thinking hard. They had something
to tell their wives about when they got home
that evening, and appeared a little thoughtful
for a day or two afterwards.</p>

<p>As they came in through the harbour gates a
small crowd of workmen watched them go by.
They didn’t see many submarines in Darlton,
and it was quite an event for them. Her mast
was hoisted and her White Ensign stood out stiffly
in the morning breeze as she stood across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
dock and tied up once more alongside the
quay.</p>

<p>The passengers stepped ashore with a sigh of
relief, and with profuse thanks for ‘an interesting
experience’ and well wishes for the future, made
off to mark the day with a red letter in their
calendars. Raymond smiled as he watched them
go. As for Seagrave, he was consulting with
Hoskins over a stiff Kingston lever, and Boyd was
closing down the gyro compass.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The final stores were taken in in the afternoon,
mostly tinned food and brass polish and the hundred
and one small items that crop up at the last moment.
The provisions presented quite a formidable array,
for the modern submarine is able to carry a large
amount for cases of necessity, which her electric
cooking-range is able to cope with, and prepare
in any manner of which the cook is capable. In
addition to her preserved rations, she also carries
sufficient fresh meat for her wants, if on a short
patrol, or at any rate enough for two or three days
if the outing is to be a lengthy one.</p>

<p>By evening the final touches had been added,
and ‘123’ lay to the quay a wiser and a better
boat. She and her officers knew a great deal
more about her than they had known before she
was hauled to pieces, and smacked and riveted
by the dockyard hordes.</p>

<p>The boat was locked up for the night, and the
coxswain and his men trooped off to supper in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
barracks; Boyd and Seagrave returned to the
hotel, and Raymond went off to the S.N.O.’s office
to report his boat finished and ready to return
to her base.</p>

<p>It was not till dinner, eaten in the dining-room
of the hotel, a chamber that reminded one of past
glories and ancient pomp and circumstance, that
he put in an appearance. The room was fairly
crowded when he arrived, as he was rather late,
and he had to thread his way between the other
guests’ chairs to reach the table the three occupied
on the window side of the room.</p>

<p>Anxious mamma glanced severely at him,
slightly bored papa exchanged a nod and a good-evening,
and demure Miss So-and-So smiled into
her plate. A large portion of the remainder were
military officers passing through the town or
staying for a short while on duty. Those of his
own seniority hailed him with aplomb; he had a
knack of making himself liked everywhere.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ queried Seagrave, as his captain sat
down.</p>

<p>‘Curious news,’ began Raymond, attacking the
soup. ‘From a Service point of view I’m fed up
about it, but from a purely personal standpoint
it’s jolly good business. We can’t go back to base
for another three days, as they can’t get an escort
before then.’</p>

<p>‘What awful rot; you’d think they’d have
plenty of Destroyers knocking about doing nothing,
or at the worst they might let us go up by ourselves.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>‘And get sunk by our own patrols on the first
night up. No thank you, George, not for mine this
journey. You as a young and able officer ought
to be jolly pleased to think you can have
another whole three days among this bevy of
beauty. You don’t make the most of your chances.’</p>

<p>‘This is such a dull hole, though,’ put in Boyd;
‘you can’t get much in the way of amusements
in the evening. What on earth can we do to shake
things?’</p>

<p>‘Now wait, I have an idea. I feel it maturing,’
said Raymond, holding his hand to his brow.
‘Don’t speak for a moment, it’s coming. Ah-h-h,
I have it! We’ll give a dance, a Submarine dance
here in the hotel; the drawing-room will be just
the place, and we’ll invite all the old fogies who’re
staying here, and a few choice spirits of our own
for leavening. It’ll be all right, the manager and
I are old pals, and I’ve done it before. I’ll try and
fix it for to-morrow night. It begins with men
only, and we give them a practice attack with
pillows for torpedoes and Boyd for the periscope.
That comes off in my room, by the way. Then we
adjourn to the drawing-room, and the damsels
troop in, and we get the show going. Little Miss
Bored Stiff, or whatever her name is, will be only
too pleased to bang on the piano, I feel sure. What
do you think of it?’</p>

<p>‘Not so dusty. What about clothes, though?’</p>

<p>‘Just monkey jackets and bow ties and white
kid gloves. Oh, and you can’t disgrace me by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
appearing in those disreputable old pumps, so
you’ll have to trot out and buy new ones. What
about you, Seagrave?’</p>

<p>‘I was just thinking. I don’t seem to remember
having a decent suit to my name, but I’ll do my
best.’</p>

<p>After dinner the manager was approached and
the subject gently broached to him. It took an
effort, but after a little while he proved amenable,
and agreed to provide decorations and refreshments
in return for the addition of certain items on the
officers’ extra bills. Miss Bored Stiff, after a deal
of gushing, agreed to do her share, and the invitations
were sent out the next morning.</p>

<p>‘The officers of H.M. Submarine “123” request
the pleasure of the company of —— at a Submarine
dance to-night in the drawing-room at 9.0. p.m.’</p>

<p>And so the invitations were accepted—all, that
is, except two, and they were two very old people,
and the preparations were duly made, and 8.30
p.m. saw a crowd of fifteen young gentlemen in
Sam Browne belts collected in Raymond’s room,
drinking their liqueurs and smoking their cigars
with the air of war-worn warriors. There was a
certain amount of noise in the room as well, in
fact it filled up most of the odd spaces where the
aforesaid young gentlemen were not sitting, but
matters were moving, and a ‘submarine attack’
was developing.</p>

<p>Boyd was dangling in mid-air from the end of
a line thrown round a stout hat-peg and made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
fast to the bed rail (he had to be the periscope
after all), and an arrangement of chairs and whatnots
represented the diving rudder wheels and
other control-room etceteras. A little way off
Seagrave stood by an arm-chair, to whose back
was fixed an ingenious arrangement, whose principal
ingredients were pillows and a length of rubber
tubing. The spectators sat where they could, and
prepared to learn the methods of attack as demonstrated
by a submarine expert.</p>

<p>At an order from Raymond, a young gentleman
with a single star upon his cuff went through the
operation of starting the motors, mimicking the
gestures of the L.T.O. working the switches at
the motor-board. The captain then gazed fixedly
between Boyd’s dangling boots and gave the
order, ‘take her down.’</p>

<p>Everybody groaned, hissed, and hooted, while
a youth in shirt sleeves splashed water in a basin
to represent the wash of the sea over the conning-tower.
Two others manipulated the diving wheel
chairs, and the hands on the face of a broken clock
were gravely moved on in imitation of the depth-gauge.</p>

<p>‘A thousand feet,’ said Raymond. ‘Hold her
at that, idiot. Oh, hell, she’s leaking.’ This as
the basin worker upset half his water. ‘Blow
40 and 50. Shake it up now. That’s better. Oh,
down, periscope,’ and Boyd was lowered to the
floor gasping.</p>

<p>‘Right now, up to thirty feet. Work that depth-gauge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
ass. Up periscope. Heave him up, never
mind if he kicks. Ha! Enemy bearing two points
on the starboard bow. Steady that helm, idiot.
Steady, I say. That’s right. Eighteen feet. Flood
the tubes.’</p>

<p>‘Flood the tubes,’ cried Seagrave, getting busy
with his arm-chair. ‘Come on now. Bear a hand
there. Tubes flooded, sir, and firing-tanks charged.
Swing the bow-cap.’ (Another youth shot through
air.) ‘That’s the style. Now we’re doing something.
All ready, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Steady the helm. Down periscope. Thirty
feet,’ continued Raymond. ‘Easy now, eighteen
feet again. Up periscope. Steady that helm now.
Carefully does it. Ahhhh. Don’t kick us, Boyd.
Stand by.’</p>

<p>‘Stand by, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Easy now. Ready to take her down. Deflections
400. Look out there; look out again and
we bump her. Now once more and ... Fire!’
and a pillow shot out of the catapult device like a
feathery cannon ball and bowled over a rather
dignified if youthful captain amid howls of delight.</p>

<p>‘Eighty feet,’ shouted Raymond; ‘take her
down, men, quick now. Oh, hell! we’re rammed,’
and the whole room rose and fell on itself in a
kicking and struggling mass.</p>

<p>‘Here, I say you fellows,’ cried the irate army
captain. ‘This is a bit thick. I’ve got decent
clothes on. You are a lot of ... of Submarine
Toughs.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>He was dragged to his feet and dried and brushed
(there had been a good deal of water floating about,
‘to make it more realistic,’ as Seagrave put it),
and his ruffled feelings were restored with whisky.
Then the party disappeared to tidy itself for the
dance, and ten minutes later the seekers after
submarine knowledge trickled down to the drawing-room
where the ‘Submarine Toughs’ were waiting
to receive the ladies, looking very angelic and
innocent in spite of the recent <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>.</p>

<p>The ladies arrived, and the dance opened with a
waltz banged out of the patient if wheezy old hotel
piano by the gushing Miss Bored Stiff, and ten
couples took the floor with great gusto, while the
manager alternately held up his hands in horror
and beamed benevolently on the revels. The
waltz was followed by a set of lancers, and the
game got really going. Supper was much in evidence,
and Sam Browne belts and dark blue and
gold dashed about with ices and claret cup, and
picked up fans and wrote things on programmes
and generally did the gallant.</p>

<p>And so, Miss Bored Stiff played, and the girls
giggled, and the mothers beamed, and even a few
of the fathers, terrifying people, were sufficiently
melted to accept a drink, and the evening wore
on and everybody enjoyed themselves. The young
gentleman in khaki, with the thin gold stripe on
his sleeve, danced with the girl in the red sash four
times, and the Army Captain acted as steward
till he lost his rosette, more by design than accident,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
and hurled himself into the two-step like a three-year-old.
Then the mothers gathered their bairns
about them, and ‘good-nights’ were exchanged,
and the fathers remained and gave expert opinions
about the war, and listened with deference to the
expert opinions of others who two years before
they would have considered babes-in-arms, and
every one went happily to bed.</p>

<p>But no one knew of the revels held in the Petty
Officers’ Mess that night to which the Sergeants
of the local defence force and their ‘good ladies’
had been invited, or of how the coxswain and the
T.I. danced attendance on the Master Gunner’s
daughter, or how Hoskins so far forgot his dignity
as to perform a step dance much to the edification
of the guests and the admiration of the entire
engine-room staff.</p>

<p>These things are secret, and the veil is never
lifted ... in public, for the next day work had
to be carried out in the Service manner, and every
one was his usual staid and former self.</p>

<p>And that’s another of the unwritten rules that
pertain to the Laws of the Navy.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>And then the final spasm when two days later
the escort Destroyer swung out of the harbour
and ‘123’ followed her, laden with kit and belongings
and spare parts, and containers, and a host
of minor matters purchased for less fortunate
comrades in the <i>Parentis</i>. Out through the dock
entrance and past the harbour heads, and Darlton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
and that dockyard and the Royal Hotel were left
behind, perhaps for good and ever. And the
Destroyer zig-zagged and the Submarine puffed
behind and was examined by trawlers and patrol-boats,
and anchored for the night, and the following
day arrived off the base once more and the familiar
scenes of work and the old routine. As they stopped
alongside the <i>Parentis</i> in the late afternoon they
were met by the ward room <i lang="fr">en masse</i> and hurried
off to gin and bitters to celebrate their arrival.
The parcels were distributed and blessings given
and curses hurled over the contents, while Raymond
and the skippers talked ‘shop’ over the alterations
and work of the re-fit. But there was something
missing, and it came out later after dinner when the
juniors had cleared off and the seniors sat round
in solemn conclave.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Carruthers, staring into the empty
grate. ‘About two weeks ago it was. Much the
same show as Shelldon’s, I expect. Just went
out and didn’t come back. Hard luck, but he
wasn’t married. A lot of his men were, though.
And old Blake was always so cheery, too.’...</p>

<p>The ward room nodded and lapsed into silence.
Somebody coughed and picked up a magazine.
Then six bells struck and the <i>Parentis</i> went to
bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_193">THE REAL THING</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> patrol had not been a very interesting one
so far, and nothing out of the way had happened.
Moreover, it was the first that ‘123’ had made
since her return to duty, and at the end of a day
at sea the crew were already slipping back to the
familiar routine. They had just finished lunch
and had been diving since four in the morning,
and nothing had occurred to break the monotony
of the usual underwater stillness. There was no
indication of what was going to happen, and the
men off watch were stretched out in the battery
compartments putting away a little over and
above their ordinary allowance of sleep, while
the control room was tenanted solely by the second
coxswain at the planes, and the helmsman, who
was biting his nails and staring into the gyro
repeater. Faint gurgles came now and again from
the vents, and occasionally the steering chain
rattled, but otherwise there was scarcely any noise.
Behind the green curtains Raymond and Seagrave
were reading magazines, and Boyd was asleep in
the little box-shaped upper bunk. The indicator
of the Forbes’ log gave a click and announced
another mile completed, and the master compass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
hummed its continuous tune to itself as it buzzed
happily round.</p>

<p>It was Seagrave who saw them first. He had
brought the boat up to eighteen feet and taken
the customary wary look round the horizon, and
the coxswain was surprised that he got no order
to ‘take her down again.’</p>

<p>Seagrave came in quietly from the control room
and tapped his skipper on the shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Will you have a look through the periscope,
sir?’ he asked.</p>

<p>Raymond looked up sharply.</p>

<p>‘Yes, all right,’ he answered, and stepped through
into the control room where the coxswain watched
him with curious eyes as he peered through the
lens.</p>

<p>Presently he lowered the instrument.</p>

<p>‘Keep her at eighteen feet,’ was all he said as
he rejoined Seagrave in the ward room.</p>

<p>‘Do you think it’s anything, sir?’ the latter
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think it is. Call Boyd.’</p>

<p>Together they pored over the chart, and the
situation was explained to the navigator, who did
mysterious things with parallel rulers, and finally
announced that they must be coming from ‘there,’
which was a well-known German base.</p>

<p>Raymond nodded, and went back to the periscope,
where he remained silent for several moments.
Away on his port bow the rim of the horizon was
broken by three tiny smudges of smoke, one behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the other, which were coming towards him over
the glassy calm sea, and would eventually cross
his bows. He took a careful bearing, and noted
that the shapes of slender hulls were forming below
the smoke blurs before he lowered the periscope
again.</p>

<p>‘Diving stations,’ he ordered.</p>

<p>‘Diving stations,’ repeated Seagrave, tingling
with anticipation, and ‘diving stations’ echoed
the coxswain, springing to life from a heavy slumber
in the after battery compartment.</p>

<p>There was no particular haste and no noise at
all. Few of the crew, with the exception of the
coxswain and one or two old campaigners who
had been with Raymond up the Marmora, had
ever made a serious attack before, but for all that
there was no excitement: this was what they had
been waiting and training for for years, and now
it had come. Rather there was an atmosphere of
pleasurable anticipation and quiet confidence that
the captain would do the right thing. They knew
their lives were in his hands. He was the only
man who could see the enemy, and if he made a
single mistake ... but then he wouldn’t make
a mistake, and it was their job to carry out his
orders and see that others did so. In two minutes
the crew were at diving stations, the L.T.O.’s at
the motor-boards, Seagrave and the T.I. at the
tubes, the coxswains at the diving wheels, and
the remainder at their various posts of Kingstons
and vents. Forward a couple were whispering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
together about some previous experience, another
man grinned sheepishly, and then Raymond’s voice
broke the silence.</p>

<p>‘Destroyers. Three of them. German all right.
Flood the tubes.’</p>

<p>The order was passed forward by Boyd and
echoed by Seagrave from the electric lit recesses
of the fore-end. They were in earnest now, and
this was the real thing.</p>

<p>‘Up periscope,’ came Raymond’s voice again,
and as the instrument slipped upwards he bent
down and slowly straightened himself with his
eye at the lens.</p>

<p>‘Boyd,’ he cried from the control room, ‘they’re
steering nor’west and bearing 160 deg. Time
1.10 p.m.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir,’ replied the navigator, notebook
in hand.</p>

<p>With the air-manifold Hoskins was blowing
water from the fore-trim into the tubes, and forward
they were watching the gauges. A hiss and a
spurt of water and the E.R.A. shut off the
blow and mopped his brow with a piece of dirty
waste.</p>

<p>‘Down periscope. Steer south-west,’ in the
incisive tones of the captain.</p>

<p>‘Firing tanks charged, sir,’ came Seagrave’s
voice from forward. ‘Tubes flooded.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay,’ called Raymond.</p>

<p>It was all so sudden. Ten minutes ago and
they had all been sleeping peacefully or keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
a monotonous and familiar watch. And now,
in another ten minutes? Well, rats in a trap
might have a better chance ... if anything went
wrong.</p>

<p>‘Up periscope,’ came the captain’s voice again.
‘Keep a steady course. Bearing 215 deg., Boyd.
Stand by.’</p>

<p>‘Stand by,’ called Seagrave from forward. Then,
as the valves and cocks were opened, ‘All ready,
sir.’</p>

<p>All eyes were glued on the gauges and meters.</p>

<p>‘When I fire dive to sixty feet,’ broke in Raymond.
‘What’s her depth? Keep her down,
man. Steady. Oh, damn! he’s seen me. Fire!’</p>

<p>As the boat shook to the release of the torpedo,
the coxswains buzzed their wheels round, but
owing to the sudden alteration in weight the boat
wouldn’t answer quickly.</p>

<p>‘Saw the wake of the periscope in this flat calm,’
went on Raymond, more to himself than the crew.
‘Oughtn’t to have attacked. Take her down, I
tell you. They’ve altered course to ram, and
they’re firing at us. Oh, hell! Flood the auxiliary.
Quick, now. Down periscope.’</p>

<p>As the auxiliary Kingston and vent came open
the boat began to feel it, and dived quickly. At
fifty feet a roaring noise overhead like a train
passing through a tunnel announced that one of
the Destroyers was passing over them, and at
eighty feet an explosion, which shook the boat to
her internals, announced that the enemy had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
dropped a depth-charge above them, and that
they had gone down none too quickly.</p>

<p>The lights went out. Somewhere the shock
had parted a lead, and for two horrible moments
they went in pitch darkness plunging down to
the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>‘What water is there, Boyd?’ came the captain’s
steady voice from the control room.</p>

<p>‘Twenty-five fathoms, sir,’ the navigator
answered out of the darkness.</p>

<p>‘All right. Hold her up, coxswain.’</p>

<p>‘Ay, ay, sir. Can’t see the depth-gauge.’</p>

<p>Then they struck. Struck the bottom at 150
feet, with a slight cant downwards at a speed of
five knots.</p>

<p>Mercifully the L.T.O., groping through the darkness,
got to the emergency switch, and the spare
lights came on just in time.</p>

<p>‘Stop the motors,’ called Raymond. ‘Is the
bow-cap closed?’</p>

<p>‘Closed it as soon as we fired, sir, and drained
the tubes,’ answered Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘Good. I fired as the leading Destroyer turned
to ram. Missed, of course, but she was firing at
us, and she’d have rammed us if we hadn’t got
the mouldies off. She had to alter course for
them, and as it was that depth-charge was pretty
close.’</p>

<p>‘Depth-gauge jammed, sir,’ reported the coxswain.
‘68 lb. pressure on the periscope gauge.’</p>

<p>Raymond frowned. His quick dive to avoid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
destruction, coupled with the sudden obscuring
of the lights, had landed him in an awkward
situation. The boat had struck bottom with her
motors under weigh, and had stuck her nose in
the mud with 150 feet of water above her. The
external pressure was 68 lb. to the square inch,
and three watchful Destroyers were up above.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought they might have the
grapnels on him, and a wild picture of having to
come up and surrender flashed across his mind.
But the men were watching him, and he knew
what he ought to do.</p>

<p>‘Is the forward depth-gauge jammed?’ he called.</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir,’ answered Boyd. ‘Only goes to a
hundred feet. It’s hard up.’</p>

<p>‘Right. Blow the buoyancy.’</p>

<p>The small tank was blown out, and in so doing
it was put to almost its tested strain (it was guaranteed
to 75 lb.) without any result. Then came
the <span class="locked">order:—</span></p>

<p>‘Group up. Astern both.’</p>

<p>‘Grouped up, sir,’ from Furness, as he brought
the switch over and started the motors. It was
just like ordinary practice dives, and he watched
his ammeters with as much detachment as if
nothing out of the way had taken place.</p>

<p>But nothing happened and the motors were
stopped. ‘123’ was stuck hard and fast, and an
uneasy feeling came over the captain. Seagrave
was in the control room by now, and Boyd was
making notes on the chart. Had they got the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
grapnels on him after all? No, of course not,
they couldn’t have....</p>

<p>‘Blow the auxiliary.’</p>

<p>The big tank was emptied, and the boat should
have had about eight tons of buoyancy and risen
like a cork. But still nothing happened, and the
gauges remained jammed and the pressure was
still 68 lb. to the square inch. Forward somebody
coughed, and the T.I. could be heard getting
two of the spare torpedoes ready to load into the
empty tubes.</p>

<p>‘Group up. Astern both,’ came the order
again.</p>

<p>For a moment there was still no result. Then
suddenly she shook herself clear from the jamb,
and rushed up to surface like an empty bottle. The
depth-gauge in the control room was out of action,
but the forward one was working again, and Boyd
sang out the readings as the boat rose.</p>

<p>‘Stop both,’ cried Raymond. ‘Ahead both.
Hard a dive. Flood the auxiliary.’</p>

<p>‘Gauge reading, sir,’ called Boyd, ‘100 feet,
and coming up fast.’</p>

<p>‘Hold her, coxswain,’ said Raymond.</p>

<p>‘Ninety feet, sir. Eighty feet, seventy, sixty,’
called Boyd. ‘Still rising fast, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Can’t keep her down, sir,’ jerked the coxswain
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>‘Damn!’ remarked Raymond. ‘She’s too light
still. Flood the buoyancy.’</p>

<p>But the tank in question had just been blown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
at 68 lb. and had a big pressure in it. It filled
but slowly, and Boyd’s voice continued monotonously
from the fore <span class="locked">compartment,—</span></p>

<p>‘Forty feet, sir. Thirty feet. Still coming up.
Twenty feet, rising fast. Ten feet. Surface.’</p>

<p>The auxiliary was flooding and nothing more
could be done. With the periscope about six
inches, Raymond lay on the deck and peeped
through the lens.</p>

<p>‘All right, they’re a mile astern. Seen us, of
course, and are coming for us. Get her down
quickly.’</p>

<p>Then the auxiliary took effect, and the boat
went down quickly, but in hand. Once more the
Destroyers, all three of them this time, were heard
passing over the top, and at a hundred feet a
muffled explosion astern told where a depth-charge
had exploded harmlessly. At 120 Raymond
steadied her, and kept her at that level.</p>

<p>‘And that’s that,’ he said, after the boat had
got her trim and the coxswains could manage her
easily. ‘So much for that. I oughtn’t to have
attacked in a flat calm; they were bound to see me.’</p>

<p>‘How far off were they when they spotted us?’
asked Boyd.</p>

<p>‘About a thousand yards. The leader opened
fire and came for us. That was just before I fired.
He’d have had us otherwise. I bet they’re rushing
all over the place now on the look out. Let’s have
a look at the chart.’</p>

<p>‘I think I’ll put the periscope up in an hour,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
he continued, ‘and have another smack if there’s
a chance, but we’d better put her on the course
for home all the same, 285 deg. it is. Then we
can sit on the bottom when we get into 12 fathoms
if necessary. How’s the battery?’</p>

<p>‘12.10 and 12.06, sir,’ answered Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘Hum, not bad. We’ve got enough amps.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> for
another attack, but it’ll mean legging it afterwards
for shallow water and sitting on the bottom till
dark. Better wait for another hour, though;
they’ll be very much on the alert just now.’</p>

<p>Forward, Seagrave and the T.I. were making
the necessary adjustments to two of the spare
torpedoes, and a little later on launched them
into the tubes. A few minor adjustments of trim
had to be made by-and-by (they were on full
fields and only doing about two knots), and presently
Seagrave reported that they were ‘all ready
forward again.’</p>

<p>The depth-gauge in the control room had been
put right and was showing a steady 120 feet, far
down out of the way of depth-charges and other
unpleasantnesses, and the time dragged slowly on.</p>

<p>‘Shook me a bit when we came right up that
time,’ remarked Raymond. ‘I made sure we
were done in and was just waiting for the bump.
When I got my eyes at the periscope they were
about a mile astern, rushing round in circles. It
wasn’t very healthy up there for a bit.’</p>

<p>‘I thought we should get it all right,’ put in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
Seagrave, ‘coming up to the surface like that.
What was the matter?’</p>

<p>‘I had to blow a good drop of water to get her
out of the mud. Then she came up with a rush
and the tank wouldn’t fill quickly enough.’</p>

<p>‘Those blessed lights going caused all the trouble.
It’ll be all right in a few minutes. The lead went
where it comes through control-room bulkhead.
Must have made the boat jump when that old
bomb went off.’</p>

<p>‘Crowded five minutes,’ remarked Boyd. ‘However,
all over and no one dead yet.’</p>

<p>‘It’s all right for you,’ said Raymond grimly.
‘But I’ve just wasted two torpedoes and over £2000
of my country’s money. If I don’t get something
to-day death will be a happy release, as I shall
probably incur their lordship’s “grave displeasure.”’</p>

<p>‘Better than losing the boat, anyway. Two
old mouldies must have shaken the Boche a bit.
How far off him did they go?’</p>

<p>‘Straddled her. I thought I’d got her at first.
Otherwise I’d have dived at once and she wouldn’t
have come so near us. The spread of the “fish”
was what did it. Now I shall have to write a
blessed explanation of it all, and you’ll read of our
miss in the next list of “torpedoes fired.” Pleasant,
isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that. First time
I’ve been under fire. Unexciting experience, too.
But I don’t want to stick in the mud and then
bounce up to the surface like that every time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
Rather too tough for amusement. I wonder what
they’re doing now. We must have entirely spoilt
their day. They must be in a state. I bet they’re
flying round looking for periscopes all over the
ocean. Anyway, they’re just as scared of us as
we are of them.’</p>

<p>‘I hope so. The battery’s our trouble. We
can’t afford to run it too low or we’ll have to sit
on the bottom here, and that won’t do the boat
any good at this depth. I expect they guess we’re
striking out for home if they know anything about
submarines, which they’re bound to. We’ll have
a look at half-past two and try another attack if
they’re anywhere near, and then head it to the
shallow water and sit tight till dark. If they’d
been a bit quicker or we hadn’t fired at them they’d
have had us that time, and they’re not likely to
give up the hunt in a hurry. I know I shouldn’t
if I thought there was an enemy submarine knocking
about.’</p>

<p>The time dragged slowly on. Every one felt
rather elevated and excited although the attack
had failed. At least they had fired live torpedoes
at the enemy, and the Destroyers were still somewhere
up above them watching for the first sight
of a periscope. The signs of the conflict had already
been removed, and save where the two empty
spaces where the spare torpedoes, now in the tubes,
had been stowed, nothing remained to show that
anything unusual had happened. In a submarine
it is either pay or play. Either you get off scot-free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
or else you don’t come back, and the names of
yourself and your crew adorn the casualty lists,
spread over several days, to divert suspicion and
the putting of two and two together by an inquisitive
public.</p>

<p>The crew were feeling pleased with themselves.
At last they had really seen something and carried
out a real attack. True, it had failed, but the
weather had been against them, and submarines
weren’t reckoned as much of a match against
Destroyers anyway, and at any rate they had all
had a shot for it. This was the thing they had
been waiting for for years, and now it <em>had</em> come
they were surprised at its suddenness and how
like peace time practice it was. Somehow they
had imagined it would be different, and yet it
wasn’t, except that the target was doing its best
to do them in, and was waiting on top for the first
sign of the periscope.</p>

<p>Dimly they began to realise that much of the
peace time routine which they had voted as unnecessary
work was of use after all when the real
thing came. The Stoker P.O. was telling the
coxswain that it was the first time he had been in
a submarine that had fired a live torpedo, and the
second coxswain was relating his experiences when
in a boat captained by an officer well known in
submarine circles, who used to exercise his crews
at diving stations in the dark, in preparation for
just such a mishap as had overtaken them this
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>Two o’clock came and went. The Forbes’ log
ticked slowly on as ‘123’ crept away from the
scene of the first attack. There was nothing to
do, and it got rather dull and monotonous after
the recent activities.</p>

<p>A thin pencil line on the chart showed where
they were heading for home and shallow water,
in case a possible second attack should run the
battery down, and necessitate sitting on the bottom
until they could rise under cover of friendly nightfall
and slip away unnoticed in the dark. It was
rather a case of the hunter hunted. Once seen
and located, and the enemy Destroyers would be
sure to press home the pursuit to the bitter end.
It seemed strange to be sitting down here under
the electric light, nibbling bits of chocolate and
reading magazines, with the knowledge that in
half an hour’s time one hoped to be having another
smack at the German a hundred odd feet above....
Still....</p>

<p>‘Diving stations,’ ordered Raymond, looking
at the clock.</p>

<p>The boat started and came to life, the men going
quietly to their places tingling with the expectancy of
what might come. Perhaps they might have better
luck this time, or perhaps ... not. Anyway....</p>

<p>‘Thirty feet,’ said Raymond. ‘Bring her up
slowly.’</p>

<p>The depth-needle crept back. Somehow there
was a slight feeling of apprehension this time.
The novelty of actual attack had worn off, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
having been through it once there was always the
feeling of what was to come. People who read
the accounts of vessels being sunk by submarines
and talk glibly of piracy and other nonsense from
the depths of their arm-chairs never realise the
nerve required to carry out those attacks, or the
feeling of being cooped up in a tiny shell out of
reach of air and sunlight, with the knowledge that
there is no quarter meted out to the undersea-forces.
Neither do they realise that orders are
orders, and that the German submarine captains
are merely obeying their orders when they torpedo
merchant ships at sight. Wrong it may be, and
undoubtedly is, but the fault lies with the higher
command and not with the individuals. Did they
disobey orders they would lay themselves open
to be shot as traitors. The so-called ‘well-worn
platitude of obeying orders’ is no chimera, but an
actual and very real fact, which urges men to
commit actions which may be wholly against their
finer feelings.</p>

<p>As the boat rose Raymond reduced to full fields,
and presently she steadied at thirty feet. Then
the periscope was raised, and after a final look
round the captain spoke <span class="locked">again,—</span></p>

<p>‘Eighteen feet. Bring her up quickly, so that
you can get down again at once if necessary.’</p>

<p>The two coxswains moved their wheels. Again
that tense, strained feeling came over the boat.
The men were all on the alert, waiting for the
expected result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p>As she came up Raymond kept his eye at the
lens watching for the moment the periscope would
break surface. The men stood by; there was
always the horrible possibility of rising right under
the keel of an enemy Destroyer.</p>

<p>At nineteen feet the captain lowered the periscope
quickly, and the boat descended to the thirty
foot level. Then came the expected <span class="locked">order,—</span></p>

<p>‘Flood the tubes.’</p>

<p>‘They’ve spread out,’ Raymond explained, as
Seagrave departed forward in a state of bustle.
‘Two of them are astern on either quarter, and the
other’s about a mile ahead. They’re looking for us,
but so far they haven’t seen us. Steer 270 deg.’</p>

<p>‘Steer 270 deg. Course, sir,’ echoed the helmsman
mechanically.</p>

<p>‘Eighteen feet,’ ordered Raymond, and up came
the periscope, the captain following the lens up
with his eye as the instrument rose.</p>

<p>‘Right. Down periscope. Keep her at her
depth. Stand by.’</p>

<p>‘Stand by, sir,’ Seagrave called out. ‘All ready,
sir.’</p>

<p>‘When I fire dive to 60 feet,’ continued Raymond.
‘Up periscope.’</p>

<p>The moment had come once more, and the eyes
of the boat were glued to gauges and meters. The
log ticked on, and the repeater-compass clicked
to itself as the seconds went by. Somewhere
forward a man sneezed, and the sound broke the
tension like the crack of a pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>‘Keep her at her depth. Steady helm now.
Sixty feet. Fire!...’</p>

<p>A few seconds tense waiting, while the boat
dived down into the safer regions. Boyd was
holding the stop-watch and counting the seconds
mechanically.</p>

<p>‘Hard-a-port,’ said Raymond. ‘Steer’....</p>

<p>Booooooom. A muffled explosion right ahead
drowned all other sounds and shook ‘123’ till she
rocked like a trawler in a sea way. Then the
helm went over and she steadied on her new
course.</p>

<p>‘Thirty-five seconds, sir,’ said Boyd, snapping
to the watch.</p>

<p>‘Got him!’ exulted Raymond, as his boat broke
into one explosive grin. ‘Keep her at 60 feet and
steer N.W. for the present.’</p>

<p>Then Seagrave came aft, his duty done, and
there being nothing else that could affect the
safety of the boat, the crew fell out from diving
stations and the officers opened the ceremonial
and only bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>‘Not so bad,’ said Raymond, raising his glass.
‘I got him as he was crossing the bow. Makes me
feel a bit ill to think of the poor beggars killed or
drowning while we’re here all nice and comfortable,
but the others will probably pick most of them up.
Here’s how.’</p>

<p>‘By Jove, it’s good business,’ chimed in Boyd,
‘and aren’t the men pleased. Thank God, we’ve
done something at last.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>‘Are you going to have a look at her presently,’
asked Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘Oh, by-and-by. We’ll carry on like this for
half an hour. They’ll be flapping about a bit up
there yet. Do you realise how lucky we’ve been,
and how many of our boats have never seen a thing
yet. You ought to go down on your graceless knees
and thank High Heaven for your good fortune.’</p>

<p>‘I do, I do. Or rather I would if this weren’t
the only pair of trousers I’ve got in the boat. Shall
I reload the tubes?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, you’d better, but we won’t fire any more
“fish” to-day, thank you. Four torpedoes for
one Destroyer is rather too expensive. Well, put
her on to 285 deg. again, and leg it for shallow
water. Let’s see, it’s three o’clock now. How’s
the battery?’</p>

<p>‘11.85 and 11.81, sir,’ came the voice of the
L.T.O., bending over the pilot-cell.</p>

<p>‘None too good,’ went on the skipper. ‘We’ll
carry on on the series switch till five o’clock, we’ll
be in 12 fathoms then, and sit on the bottom till
dark. Ten o’clock will do it, I think.’</p>

<p>‘How about having a look at them?’ inquired
Seagrave.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think we might as well. I can’t resist
the temptation much longer. We’d better go to
diving stations, though, before we rise.’</p>

<p>Once more the boat came up, and at twenty-one
feet the periscope was slowly hoisted and Raymond
took his quick look round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>‘All right,’ he announced to the expectant crew.
‘She’s sinking fast by the head—the others are
standing by. Hit her right amidships and blown
two of her funnels out. There’s a lot of things
floating in the water, though, and a boat is dodging
about. She’s almost gone. Want a look?’</p>

<p>Seagrave and Boyd in turn stepped to the periscope
and gazed at the stricken Destroyer, now
at her last gasp. Her comrades were dashing
round her at high speed in a wide circle, and heads
and debris of all sorts were bobbing on the surface.</p>

<p>‘Beastly, isn’t it?’ said Raymond, taking another
look. ‘Makes you feel a bit sick to think we’re
responsible for it all. Ah! there she goes. She’s
under now. I’d like to get another, all the same,
but rather too risky. Right. Down periscope
40 feet. Fall out diving stations.’</p>

<p>Then they went down once more to the greeny
depths, and the normal routine was resumed. But
it wasn’t quite the same. From the other side
of the curtains the whispering voices of the men
and the subdued talk from aft had taken on a new
tone. To all appearances they were back to ordinary
diving routine, the coxswain and helmsmen
in the control room and the rest scattered over
the boat, but a subtle change had taken place.
Before, they had been playing at it, but now, well,
those heads bobbing on the water were mute
evidence of the experience they had been through.</p>

<p>Perhaps in the heat of an action it may be
different, and one may feel differently about it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
but in a submarine where no one but the captain
sees the enemy there is always rather an aftermath
to cold-bloodedness, a realisation of what the
others have gone through. True, at the time, one
realises that if the enemy is not put under, one’s
own boat and her crew will be, but after the first
excitement has worn off and the torpedoes have
been fired and found their mark, comes the feeling
of not having given the men a sporting chance,
the feeling one had at school after having ‘dotted
the other fellow’ one on the nose or taken the
starch out of some one who was always ridiculing
us. One wanted to shake hands afterwards and
be magnanimous (horrible word), and forget the
whole thing. But there was no shaking hands
here, and there were some who wouldn’t shake
hands again ever ... up there ... heads
bobbing on the sea. Beastly.....</p>

<p>The whisperings grew fainter, and the talk in the
after compartment flagged and ceased. The men
off watch were dropping off to sleep, and Seagrave
and Boyd had clambered into their bunks. Forward
the four empty racks showed the day’s work done,
and behind the tube doors the spare torpedoes
were shipped and ready in case of necessity.</p>

<p>Raymond sat writing out his report, a short,
concise narrative of the events, for the benefit of
Captain Charteris and ‘their Lordships,’ those
vague beings of Whitehall whose opinions rule
the Naval world.</p>

<p>There was no periscope watch just yet, as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
too dangerous to risk being seen for a while, and
‘123’ jogged slowly homewards (she was due in
to-morrow morning) at the forty feet level, at
the sedate speed of slightly under two knots an
hour.</p>

<p>At four o’clock tea appeared, and the boat came
to life once more. Men could be heard passing
aft on their way to the meal, and an opening of
lockers and clattering of crockery announced the
progress of the meal. In the ward room the officers
took theirs off the chart-table and talked of mice
and men.</p>

<p>‘Seems a bit queer to sit here and eat bread
and jam,’ said Boyd, breaking a momentary
silence, ‘with all those beggars killed up there,
and the rest of them either in a blue funk or dashing
about to Gott strafe us. I wonder what they’re
up to. Are you going to have another look?’</p>

<p>‘After tea,’ said Raymond, ‘and then we’ll have
to sit down at five o’clock. About twelve fathoms,
isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Twelve and a half, I make it,’ replied Boyd.
‘Anyway, quite shallow enough, and only 140 miles
from home. Shall we rise at ten o’clock?’</p>

<p>‘Depends how dark it is. We’ll have to put on
a big charge on the way home, and start it as soon
as we rise; it won’t do the battery any good to
be left as it is now for too long.’</p>

<p>When the meal was cleared away, the boat was
brought to eighteen feet and the periscope hoisted
once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>‘All serene-oh,’ said Raymond. ‘They’re about
four miles astern, I reckon. Can’t see much but
the smoke. Down periscope. Thirty feet. We’ll
start periscope watch again,’ he added, turning
to Seagrave. ‘Keep a good look out at them.’</p>

<p>Boyd took over the watch, and the old order
was re-established, the boat rising to eighteen
feet for the ‘look-see’ every ten minutes, and then
going down again to thirty feet.</p>

<p>Somehow the time dragged on, but it wasn’t
very interesting, and every one was looking forward
to ten o’clock and fresh air after the day’s turmoils.</p>

<p>Then five o’clock arrived, and the crew were once
more ordered to diving stations, and Raymond
took the periscope and had a final look round.</p>

<p>‘Nothing in sight,’ he announced. ‘Seventy-five
feet of water, coxswain, and sixteen feet below
us. We ought to ground with about fifty-nine
feet on the gauge. Take her down.’</p>

<p>She went down slowly. At thirty feet Raymond
stopped the motors and let a little water into the
auxiliary through the vent, as she lost weight.</p>

<p>‘How’s the bubble?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Midship, sir. She’s horizontal,’ answered the
coxswain.</p>

<p>The depth-needle crept on. Fifty feet, fifty-five,
sixty, sixty-two, and then a light jar was
felt and a faint upward pressure on the soles of
the feet like a passenger feels when a lift reaches
the bottom of the shaft in a Tube station.</p>

<p>The boat was on the bottom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>‘Six tons in the auxiliary,’ ordered Raymond.
The boat took on a slight list to port and then
righted and lay still. The depth-meter was steady
at fifty-two feet.</p>

<p>‘Fall out diving stations,’ said the captain.
‘One hand keep watch in the control room and call
me if the depth-meter shifts or we take on a list,
coxswain.’</p>

<p>The crew dispersed and the officers returned to
the ward room.</p>

<p>An even deader stillness than usual prevailed
now that the boat was stationary and had gone
to sleep on the bottom. The talk of the men in
the after compartment drifted in and was the only
sound that broke the underwater silence. In the
control room sat the watch-keeper with his eyes
on the gauges, sixty-two feet on the depth-gauge,
and thirty pounds pressure to the square inch.
The long-suffering battery was having a rest and
the crew proceeded to follow its example.</p>

<p>Raymond and Boyd turned in and Seagrave
picked up a book. Above, somewhere astern,
were two pannicky Destroyers and other things
as well; and somewhere else, at the bottom of the
sea also, was the dead Destroyer who would destroy
no more.... Ah, well....</p>

<p>Dinner came at eight o’clock, rather a sumptuous
affair in honour of the occasion, and full justice
was done to the cook’s culinary efforts to live up
to the event. Finally the bottle was opened after
a teetotal meal, and Boyd poured out the port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>‘As somebody or other once wisely observed,’
said Raymond, as he prepared to drink, ‘a drop of
whisky makes the whole world kin, but give me
a touch of the good old fruity as a really finishing
end to a perfect day. Whew! it’s getting stuffy.’</p>

<p>‘Always seems to after dinner,’ replied Boyd.
‘Must be the effort of eating after sixteen hours’
diving, or else we eat so much that there isn’t any
room for fresh air.’</p>

<p>‘Or much air, either,’ said Seagrave, ‘not after
twenty or so other people have used it. This is
the longest dive I’ve ever done, but as regards the
amount of grub eaten, that’s entirely a personal
matter. Do you mean to insinuate....’</p>

<p>‘That you ate a pound of cherries to-day? Of
course I do. I admit I’ve been asleep most of the
day, but whenever I’ve woken up and cocked an
eye over the bunkboard I’ve seen you gobbling
fruit like a schoolgirl at a bun struggle.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I’ve had a system, and I haven’t been
able to work it this patrol, but the idea is to eat
six cherries between looks through the “perisher,”
and suck the stones while I’m there.’</p>

<p>‘Beastly habit,’ said Raymond. ‘We’ll have
to stop bringing out fruit if it’s going to lead to
these debauches.’</p>

<p>‘And deprive me of my sole pleasure in life.
That’s a bit ’ard.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a bit ’ard on me that I can’t get any cherries
at all on account of your gormandising habits.
That’s what’s a bit ’ard.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>‘Are you going to wait till ten before rising?’
asked Boyd, changing the subject skilfully.</p>

<p>‘It’s getting a bit fuggy, so I think we’ll come
up at nine-thirty. What time is it now?’</p>

<p>‘Nine o’clock. I shan’t be sorry to get up, for
one. That’ll be seventeen hours and a half, and
quite long enough for my small needs. I’m not
ambitious in that direction.’</p>

<p>‘No, I think we’ll make it half-past nine. You’d
better warn them in the engine-room, Seagrave,
that we’ll want full speed as soon as possible after
rising. One can’t say that they’re not still on the
look-out for us, and we can’t afford to hang about.’</p>

<p>Boyd busied himself with his charts and laid
the course for home. ‘A hundred and thirty-five
miles to go,’ he pronounced, ‘at twelve knots gets
us in at about nine to-morrow morning. Just a
good time to come in, <em>and</em> a silk ensign and the
skull and crossbones.’</p>

<p>‘Hardly a good enough bag for all that,’ said
the captain; ‘we might run to the silk ensign,
I think, but we’ll hang on to the other till we sink
a Hun Dreadnought or a big Fritz or something
of that sort. All ready, Seagrave? Right. Diving
stations.’</p>

<p>Then they rose, rose swiftly off the bottom, and
steadied at twenty feet, when Raymond hoisted
the periscope.</p>

<p>‘Seems quite dark,’ he said. ‘Always looks
darker through the periscope than it really is,
though. Good enough, blow 1, 2, and 3.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>When the hatch was opened it <em>was</em> considerably
lighter than expected, and the engines were started
off and worked up to full speed as soon as possible.
Raymond wouldn’t allow any one but himself,
Boyd, and the helmsman on the bridge, and all
unnecessary gear was left below. Even the bridge
screen remained furled, and the captain kept a
steady look-out aft for possible pursuers.</p>

<p>Luckily the sea was still calm, and they got well
away by midnight, after which the crew were
allowed on deck and things made comfortable
for the night. It had been a queer feeling, though,
rising from the bottom of the sea up into the dusk,
the quick hustle and the scurry for home, and the
keen look-out aft through the gloom for signs of
an enemy who might have seen the boat push her
way up out of her watery funk-hole.</p>

<p>However, she was safe now, and the night slipped
by with the usual surface watches, and daylight
found ‘123’ off the coast and heading for the faint
outline of home just visible on the horizon.</p>

<p>Then the sun rose higher and the land disappeared,
to become visible again later on about
twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>The silk ensign, sign of conquest and good luck,
was hoisted, and ‘123’ made her number and
answered the challenge. The outside patrols
became active and the mine-sweepers on their
outward way dragged past them, their kites towing
behind and bouncing over the water as they went.
Somebody on a trawler evidently saw what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
interested him, for a telescope went up and
then came the signal. ‘Hearty congratulations,’
semaphored across in slow and painful sections
by a shock-haired boy in a pair of baggy
trousers.</p>

<p>‘Thanks very much,’ replied ‘123,’ as she hurried
on to the harbour and headed through the gate.
Then up and through the Fleet, the silk ensign
fluttering in the breeze, and the boat came to rest
once more alongside the <i>Parentis</i> and outside the
trot of submarines. Then she made fast, and the
crew grinned at one another and broke away,
carrying the debris of the trip down to the mess-decks.</p>

<p>‘’Ullo, cocky,’ said a man who was hammering
an iron plate, ‘’ad a good trip?’</p>

<p>‘You bet we ’ave,’ replied the one addressed,
who was carrying a bucket full of potatoes and
a loaf of bread. ‘You bet we ’ad. Saw Fritz, too.’</p>

<p>‘Reely. You ’it ’im?’</p>

<p>‘Course we did, do you <span class="locked">think——’</span></p>

<p>Somewhere up on the quarter-deck a voice
<span class="locked">said,—</span></p>

<p>‘Hallo, Raymond’s back. Gee-whiz. Look what
he’s flying. What is it, Raymond?’</p>

<p>‘Only a wee one,’ came the answer.</p>

<p>‘You lucky beggar. Captain wants to see you,
by the way.’</p>

<p>And there we will leave him, making his formal
report in the Service way to Captain Charteris,
while the story ran round the mess-decks, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Lower Deck wireless, where it was received with
nods of approval and caustic criticism by those
who had been through it all before, and knew the
details, and could fill in the gaps for themselves.
The Depot blinked a bit over the issue of four new
torpedoes, but albeit she was satisfied and sat
down again and said nothing.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>That night after dinner the story was retold
in the ward room, embellished, and with detail,
the listeners taking an immense professional interest
in the narrative, and agreeing and disagreeing
with one another on what they would have done
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>‘When I saw my bloke last month,’ said Austin,
‘I left him severely alone. It was a flat calm, and
I thought Destroyer-dodging wasn’t good enough.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ put in Johnson, ‘I think I’d
have had a shot if I’d been in your place. One
can only miss after all.’</p>

<p>‘The point is, though,’ this from Carruthers,
‘is it worth while risking the loss of one’s boat
for the sake of one Destroyer? Personally, I don’t
think it is.’</p>

<p>‘I agree there,’ replied Austin; ‘a submarine,
now, is a different thing. If I thought I had the
vaguest chance of straffing a U-boat I’d go in for
it whatever the cost. I think myself that it would
be as much loss to Germany from a purely military
point of view as it would be if I sank a Dreadnought.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>‘That may be,’ said Johnson, ‘but I do think
that whatever you see you ought to have a smack
at, and I give Raymond full points for his stunt
of yesterday. It’s undoubtedly a nasty job
messing about with Destroyers or anything at all,
for that matter, on a calm day, but I think it’s
worth it if there’s a reasonable chance of getting
something.’</p>

<p>‘I was in two minds about it myself,’ broke in
Raymond, ‘but they were so bally tempting
I couldn’t resist it, and then when I’d missed I
felt I couldn’t come back without having another
shot and getting something for my money.’</p>

<p>‘Risky job, my boy, risky,’ cried the Torpedo
Lieutenant from the depth of his arm-chair.
‘Mustn’t be too bold and rash, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, shut up, Torps, and don’t gass so much.
The blessed “fish” ran straight, and that’s all
you need worry about. When I feel particularly
suicidal I’ll take you out with me and do the job
in style. We’ll all drown together and go down to
posterity in the guise of saints then, a <em>dis</em>guise
by the way of a most efficient order in your
case.’</p>

<p>‘Your pardon, Lord. I shall refuse to come.’</p>

<p>‘Thank God for that.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall most certainly <em>insist</em> on coming
next trip. I <span class="locked">shall——’</span></p>

<p>‘How far off were they when you first saw them?’
broke in a voice from the other end of the ward
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, about four miles. I saw the smoke at
first and hustled off in their direction.’</p>

<p>‘You must have had a pretty long fug afterwards,
didn’t you?’</p>

<p>‘It was a bit mouldy sitting on the bottom, but
we managed to turn up smiling.’</p>

<p>The talk drifted out and turned to other topics.
‘178’ was due in to-morrow, and her patrol and
herself and her officers were also discussed with
much freedom. Later the ward room was closed,
and the <i>Parentis</i> went to sleep, but still with one
eye open, and watchful to guard the charges that
lay alongside her.</p>

<p>Next day Carruthers and Johnson went out on
patrol, and in the late afternoon a new boat arrived,
fresh and hot from the dockyard, commanded by
one Singleton, an officer well known to the boat
captains of the <i>Parentis</i>.</p>

<p>Raymond and Austin had a day off, rather an
unexpected favour in the case of the former, who
had only just returned from re-fit, and decided to
spend it in the country. They left early and caught
a train after breakfast for the sleepy little town
of Langton, some twenty miles distant. After
the noise and bustle of a shipbuilding and mining
centre, the pleasant peace of the English country
came as a welcome change, and they lay back in
their carriage and drank in great gulps of the fresh
morning air as the local rattled sedately on. A
fine summer day and the hedges alongside the
railway, and the fields all gold, brown, and green,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
with little cottages nestling among them, and level
crossings with children who waved sitting on the
gates, and horses grazing, and reaping machines,
and white high loads. Hayricks and little villages,
small woods and distant spires. Imagine all this
under the heel of an invader! The woman in the
blue print apron standing outside the cottage,
the children playing with the farmer’s old dog
among the barley sheaves, imagine them with the
Germans in possession ... butchery, rape, and
at the best robbery and ill-treatment, and yet
Belgium....</p>

<p>It didn’t bear thinking of. There was no possibility
of invasion or wanton destruction. It hadn’t
happened for hundreds of years, but then ...
it must have been the same when the horsemen
rode in and the old muzzle-loaders blared out,
and men died and women shrieked and children
clung to their mothers’ skirts, wide eyed and
amazed.</p>

<p>It might happen, it might come to pass, and the
very security of England was the worst danger of
all. A hundred thousand troops landed overnight
and the result ... fields laid waste, and killing
and disasters, the soul of the English country
changed to its very core. It might have happened
two years ago, but not now. At a moment’s call
the sleeping country could spring to life, and armed
men, as if born of dragons’ teeth, would appear
to repel the invader, armed not with shields and
stabbing spear, but with machine-guns and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
deadly howitzer. England had found herself.
Not for a hundred years had she so proved her soul
to herself and to the world. The call came, and
slowly but surely the old spirit, latent for a century,
revived and had its being, openly once more and
for all the world to see....</p>

<p>The train drew up with a jolt, and Austin broke
the silence with a casual remark.</p>

<p>‘Pretty little station. See those wild roses
growing by the lamp-post there. Reminds you of
pre-war days, doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>Outside, the good old-fashioned station fly
rumbled them over the cobbles and into the High
Street, where the women stared at the uniforms,
and a small boy shouted something and ran after
them. Then lunch at the one and only, called
rather grandly the Imperial Hotel, albeit an old
place, relic of the coaching days, though with a
new master and up-to-date methods. Old prints
on the walls of the ‘Fox Hunt,’ old furniture, and
beer in pewter tankards reminded one of the ancient
glories of the place, when the London mail would
roll in with a tootling of horns and shouting of
postboys, and be off again amid good-byes and
handshakes, and ‘Write soon when you get to
London,’ from mother, and a ten shilling tip from
father, while little Alfred sucked his finger and
stared.</p>

<p>The lunch consisted of the cold roast beef of
England, and salad and cheese and fruits, and
afterwards they wandered out into the sunshine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
and up the High Street, tenanted now by only a
few loafers, outside the Red Lion, and a boy or
two on bicycles by the local post office.</p>

<p>The market square offered but few attractions,
and the friends wandered through the town, which
ended as abruptly as the bow of a ship, and out
into the country beyond.</p>

<p>After his recent experiences Raymond found
the situation almost too deep for words, and they
trudged on, smoking their pipes, for the most part
in silence.</p>

<p>Presently they topped the summit of a little
hill and looked back on the town, a smudge of
gray and brown buildings against the blue sky,
the church spire in the centre, and the smoke curling
lazily up in the afternoon haze. Away to the
eastward was a thin strip of blue, where lay the
sea and ships and submarines and war.</p>

<p>They turned their backs to it. For one day at
least they would forget it, and Germany and War
and sudden death.</p>

<p>Later on came tea taken in the garden of a little
cottage which modestly displayed the card ‘Teas’
in a window, where they were served by the good
lady’s daughter with home-made bread and cake
and jam, and then lay back and smoked and
thought of things and men and the country and
England. Then they paid the bill, stroked the
cat, gave the child some pennies, and wandered
on at peace with the world, themselves, and
everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>They started back towards Langton, but the
sound of bells drew them from the main road to
where a little ivy-covered church nestled lonely
and almost forgotten by the wayside. They took
off their caps and went in. After the glare outside
they blinked and groped in the dusk of the church
until the light grew better and they saw where
they had strayed.</p>

<p>‘I say,’ said Raymond, ‘this is a Catholic Church;
hadn’t we <span class="locked">better——’</span></p>

<p>‘That’s all right,’ said Austin. ‘We’ll sit here
a minute.’</p>

<p>They found a pew and looked round them. Up
by the altar a priest was standing with his back
towards them. Two boys in surplices were standing
near. Then an organ burst out somewhere, and
the few worshippers took up the refrain and sang
the <i>Tantum Ergo</i>.</p>

<p>The two men knelt down.</p>

<p>Later a bell rang and the old priest bent
down over the altar. He raised something in his
hands. Infinite quiet, the sound of heart beats,
and the lists of the parish killed in action stood
out sharply on either side of the sanctuary. The
priest was moving away with the boys before
him.</p>

<p>The organ crashed out again, and Raymond
caught the <span class="locked">words:—</span></p>

<p>‘<i lang="la">Quoniam confirmata est super nos misericordia
ejus: et veritas Domini manet in aeternum.</i>’</p>

<p>‘The truth of the Lord remaineth for ever.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>They stepped out into the sunlight and blinked
in the glare of the high road.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Later, the return to the base and the motor
ride to the harbour, and the steamboat off to the
<i>Parentis</i>. A return to the world of men and ships,
where the war was the essence of life and the main
topic of conversation. The ward room was discussing
the newly-arrived boat which was to take
the place of Blake’s.</p>

<p>Singleton was a man of merry moods, and kept
them going with stories of his struggles with the
contractors and the trials he had been through
while his boat had been building.</p>

<p>‘A hell of a lot of work,’ he concluded, ‘and didn’t
get any “command money” for seven weeks either.’</p>

<p>‘<em>And</em> had a fine fat time of it ashore, I bet,’
remarked the Staff Paymaster lightly.</p>

<p>‘Not so bad, not so bad, but nothing to write
home about. Not married, you know. Found
things pretty dull in the evening.’</p>

<p>‘Ah,’ said the Engineer Commander, ‘I married
ten years ago, and haven’t spent more than a fortnight
at a time with my wife ever since. Some
people have all the luck.’</p>

<p>‘I agree with Mr Punch,’ chimed in the Torpedo
Lieutenant. ‘As regards to marriage I could say
three words—The first is “don’t,” the second
is “don’t,” and the third is “don’t.” With my
knowledge of the world my opinion is worth
considering.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>

<p>‘Had a good day?’ asked the First Lieutenant
of Austin, disregarding the Torpedo Lieutenant’s
remark.</p>

<p>‘Very. Just wandered about in the country
and smoked and thought and took in the view.
Later on we got into a small church where they
were having benediction or something. Made
you feel all funny to hear it.’</p>

<p>‘I can’t imagine much shaking you,’ said the
Fleet Surgeon. ‘You must have been in a very
thoughtful mood.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose I was. It was the quiet and the
country and the rabbits and things. Little things,
you know, but things that count sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘——And when I got my periscope up,’ said
a voice from the other side of the ward room, ‘I
saw Fritz had manned his guns and was letting
the tramp have it for all he was worth. Fairly
potting him he was. So I kept well to leeward
of father tramp, and then dodged suddenly round
the bow and fired.’</p>

<p>‘Did you get him?’ asked Seagrave’s voice.</p>

<p>‘By good luck, yes. Right amidships. Then
I went down, and came up for a look ten minutes
later. There wasn’t any submarine there, but
the tramp saw my periscope and thought I was
Fritz, and gave me hell for about thirty seconds
until I got well down out of harm’s way. I bet
the skipper reported having sunk a U-boat.’</p>

<p>‘You got your shift shortly afterwards, didn’t
you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>‘Two months or so,’ replied Singleton. ‘Since
then I’ve been one of the idle poor and lived on
the fat of the land, or such fat as I could acquire
owing to the Food Controller. Glad to be back
at work, though. It gets pretty mouldy sitting
in a dockyard and hoping the war won’t be over
before you get to sea again.’</p>

<p>‘When are you doing a patrol?’</p>

<p>‘Day after to-morrow, I expect. Bit of a rush,
isn’t it? Have to move round in the meantime
and see things in order, as I don’t know much of
her little ways yet, though she’s seemed all right
so far.’</p>

<p>Boyd was comparing notes with the new navigator
and discussing the possible vagaries of
magnetic compasses in submarines. Seagrave
drifted off with the new ‘Sub,’ and later on a bugle
sounded overhead and six bells struck. Somebody
came to the door and reported eleven o’clock,
and the ward room emptied itself.</p>

<p>Raymond wandered up on to the quarter-deck
and leant over the rail and gazed at the anchored
Fleet. Behind him the officer of the watch was
padding up and down, and by the gangway the
quartermaster and corporal of the watch were
talking in low tones. The side boy looked at him
curiously.</p>

<p>‘Britain’s sure shield’ was keeping her silent
watch. Beyond lay the big ships, and beyond
them again a host of merchant vessels, supply
ships, colliers, and hospitals. Outside, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Destroyers would be keeping their never-ceasing
patrol, and the trawlers and mine-sweepers would
be bobbing to the north-east swell. The wind caught
him chillily, and he shuddered and turned up his
collar.</p>

<p>A voice sounded from for’ard, high up on the
bridge, then one bell struck, and he turned and
went below.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_233">‘FOR THOSE IN PERIL ON THE SEA’</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">This</span> is a story of the early days of submarines,
and the whole affair happened a long while ago—some
years before the War, in fact—beyond which
milestone the memory of modern man now rarely
attempts to wander. The first news I received
on the subject was from the centre sheet of a
morning paper, an extract from which ran as
<span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘H.M. Submarine “02” was lost in the Channel
whilst exercising on Tuesday, 16th inst. There
are only two survivors, Lieut. Allison, R.N., the
second in command, and Stoker 1st Class P.&#160;W.
Howell. All hope has been abandoned for the
remainder of the crew, as “02” has now been
under water for more than 58 hours, and the
divers report that it will be impossible to lift her
for another two days. Lieut. Belton, R.N., the
captain, was the son of Admiral Belton, K.C.B.,
R.N., etc.’</p>
</div>

<p>Now I knew Allison. I knew him well, and I
scented the chance of gaining a little more information
on the subject than could be gleaned from
the morning paper, but I deemed it wise to wait<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
a little and not rush things too much. His photograph,
a rather blotchy affair, appeared in more
than one penny pictorial, and I felt sure of my
man. However, I went wisely about my business,
and put the matter away in an upper brain pigeon-hole,
to be produced at the right moment.</p>

<p>I waited a good long while, six weeks, to be
exact, until I felt sure that Allison’s survivor’s
leave would be a thing of the past, and then I
sallied out and bought the current Navy List.
I’ve said it all happened long before the War, when
those who took an interest in the movements of
naval officers could satisfy their thirst in the leaves
of the Blue journal. Nowadays these things are
altered, and the Navy List, which grows and
increases monthly, is kept locked up with the
other secret books in the confidential safe.</p>

<p>In its mystic pages I found what I wanted.
John Hugh Allison (Lieut.) was ‘for command
of Submarine “90” (building).’ I knew what
that meant. He’d had his leave all right and been
appointed to a new boat, as yet uncompleted,
and was standing by to superintend the work of
the dockyard, and to take her to sea as captain
when she was finished.</p>

<p>I thought a while and concocted a piece of
villainy. Then I sent the following telegram:
‘Commanding Officer, H.M. Submarine “90.”
Congratulate you on your promotion. When may
I come and marvel?’</p>

<p>He fell into the trap (did I say that the telegram<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
was reply paid?), and sent the cryptic answer:
‘Many thanks. Come Monday, and be damned.’</p>

<p>The telegram was handed in at Portsmouth,
so I knew at once at what yard the boat was being
built, and Monday morning saw me hustling down
from London full of my fell intentions.</p>

<p>I knew I shouldn’t get into the yard even in
peace time, so I hung round outside till a villain
in a working rig appeared carrying a coil of wire.
He bore on his cap-ribbon the legend ‘H.M. Submarines,’
and I marked him from afar. It appeared
that the ‘Captain’ was living at the Royal Arms
Hotel, and thither I hied me and demanded that
he be produced.</p>

<p>He wasn’t in. He was still down in the mystic
dockyard and wouldn’t be back till lunch, so I
made myself comfortable in a corner of the smoking-room
and awaited what the gods might give.</p>

<p>In due course the gift appeared, in a ragged
uniform, and wearing a harassed expression. On
seeing me he uttered a roar of appreciation (he
was quite twenty-five), and caused drinks to be
produced with the celerity of a conjuror.</p>

<p>Then we lunched and discussed many things,
from cocoa to spots under the sun, but never once
did I refer to the subject that was in my mind;
but after the meal was over I asked him how he
liked his new boat and what he thought of her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, not so dusty for a first command; you
wouldn’t like to see over her, would you?’ He
eyed me tentatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>‘Rather a long way to the dockyard, isn’t it?’
I hazarded.</p>

<p>‘Oh, be a sport,’ he continued. ‘I’d like you
to see her, you know. You’re the first civilian
to come and see me here.’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ I agreed, ‘I’ll come, but don’t be
too long-winded over it.’</p>

<p>Then I smiled the smile of the evil-doer, and
followed him in silence to the penny tram. Under
his protecting wing I was borne into the yard, and
presently came on ‘90,’ where she was being whacked
and riveted and hammered into shape.</p>

<p>It was like all other visits to dockyards, and
secretly I was rather glad when it was over, but
I had gained my host’s confidence in me and felt
well pleased with my afternoon’s work.</p>

<p>We had tea at Southsea, and talked over old
times and many other things, and then returned
once more to the hotel and dinner. I refused all
invitations to the Hippodrome afterwards, having
my purpose in view, and when we reached the
coffee and liqueur stage I felt that the psychological
moment had arrived. I didn’t rush things, however;
I led up to it gently, and let him have it in small
doses till he swallowed the bait.</p>

<p>Hard and uphill work, but it came off in the end.</p>

<p>He had been explaining some of the advantages
his new command had over the older boats he had
served in, and I felt the time was ripe.</p>

<p>‘How does she compare,’ I hinted, and ended
with a lowered voice, ‘with poor old “02”?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>He coloured a bit and hesitated, and I thought
that all was lost, <span class="locked">then,—</span></p>

<p>‘Taking her all round,’ he answered slowly,
‘“02” wasn’t in the same street. She was a good
old packet, though.’ He sighed.</p>

<p>I passed the port again and waited.</p>

<p>‘It might have happened to any type of boat,
you know, really,’ he continued. ‘It was a sheer
bit of bad luck.’</p>

<p>It was coming, and I nodded in silence.</p>

<p>‘I’ve never been able to quite make out how it
happened,’ he went on. ‘Whether poor old Belton
made a mistake, or the Dutchman got scared and
put his helm over.’</p>

<p>‘The Dutchman?’ I queried.</p>

<p>‘Norwegian tramp bound out for the Atlantic.
Off Portland we were. We’d been told off with
a T.B. for practice attacks, and were in shallow
water at the time, about ten fathoms. About
ten o’clock in the morning it was, and lovely weather
too. The T.B. was away on ahead of us, and just
before we dived we noticed a steamer about six
miles off coming towards us down Channel. I
remember pointing her out to Belton. Then we
went under, and I was busy for’ard with the “fish.”
Belton had taken careful bearings of the tramp,
and I’m not sure whether he got so interested in
his attack that he didn’t pay enough attention to
her, or whether the tramp suddenly saw the T.B.’s
flag and banged the helm over. I think it was a
bit of both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>‘We’d been diving about half an hour when
the skipper ordered me to “flood the tubes,” and
about five minutes later I got the order “stand
by.” You know how those old boats were, the
way the sluice door worked and so on?’</p>

<p>I nodded and sipped my drink.</p>

<p>‘The T.I. and I brought her to the ready and
reported, and then came the stillness that immediately
precedes a shot; you know, everybody
waiting for the order.</p>

<p>‘“Stand by” Belton called again, and then to
the coxswains, “when I fire, forty feet.”</p>

<p>‘It was just then that I thought I heard a sound,
the rumbling noise of a train in a tunnel or the
screw of a steamer close to. I imagined it was
the T.B., and I remember thinking that Belton
was taking her rather close to the target. The
noise got louder and louder, and the men began
to look at one another, and then I heard the
skipper’s voice from the control room.</p>

<p>‘“Flood the auxiliary,” he shouted, and I knew
by his voice that something was wrong. “Take
her down,” he cried, “lively now.”</p>

<p>‘Then I heard an E.R.A. calling for a wheel-spanner,
and I ran aft to find that the Kingston
had jammed and they couldn’t open it, and all
the time the noise was getting louder and louder.
We flooded the buoyancy and speeded up, and
she was just going down (you know we always
carried a light trim in those old boats) when the
rumbling grew into a roar and there was a terrific<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
clang for’ard and a rush of water, and we knew
that some one’s propeller had cut clean through
the skin. The lights went out and there was
another bang and spout of water in the after compartment,
and down we went.</p>

<p>‘“Control room, men,” yelled Belton. “Close
the engine-room bulkhead.”</p>

<p>‘Somebody brought it to, and as the engine-room
wasn’t pierced we knew we had that much
buoyancy at any rate, and with the water pouring
in in sheets we hit the bottom and the men tumbled
into the control room and banged the doors. There
was a good four feet of water there by then, and
we’d filled the bilge.</p>

<p>‘Luckily some one had brought an emergency
lamp with him, and we switched it on down there
in the darkness. The depth-gauge was steady at
48 feet, and the crew was packed in that small
air-lock. We could hear the water rising on both
sides of us, and spurts of it came through the watertight
doors. Then by-and-by the sound ceased,
and we knew that save for the engine-room and
the control room the boat was full up to the hatches.’</p>

<p>‘My God,’ I grunted involuntarily, as Allison
paused to drink.</p>

<p>‘We mustered the crew,’ he continued, ‘and
found that two were missing: a stoker named
Howell who had been on watch doing some job
or other in the engine-room, and had been shut in
when the bulkhead door was closed, and the T.I.,
who had been with me at the tubes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>‘The stoker, of course, would be all right so far,
and as it happened he saved himself and is in
hospital now recovering from shock. The T.I.,
we knew, was dead. He must have tripped over
something in the darkness on his way aft, and the
door had been closed before he could get to it.
Poor devil, there was a gash about two feet long
in the hull, and he must have watched the water
rising till it jammed him up against the arch of
the roof and drowned him as it rose.</p>

<p>‘Poor old Belton looked anxious; he had the
lives of all of us on his hands, and the men just
stood round and said nothing.</p>

<p>‘We blew what we could, but she hadn’t got a
central control like we have in the later boats,
and of course nothing happened. The depth-gauge
stuck at 48 feet, and the air was getting bad already.
There were fourteen of us in the control room—a
space about seven feet by nine.</p>

<p>‘I was standing by one of the bulkhead doors,
and was the first to suspect it. I didn’t say anything
till I was sure, and smelt and smelt again
till there was no doubt about it. The water had
got to the batteries, and chlorine gas was creeping
through the doors.</p>

<p>‘There was only one way out of it, and that was
the old conning-tower dodge. We reckoned we
had about half an hour to live, as the gas was only
coming in slowly, and we might be able to save
the lot if the air didn’t give out first.</p>

<p>‘You know the shaft of the conning-tower that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
leads down into the control room has two hatches,
one at the top, opening out on deck, and the other
at the bottom where the shaft breaks out into the
skin of the hull. The space between was just big
enough for a man to stand, and forms an air-lock.</p>

<p>‘I wanted Belton to go up first, but of course
he wouldn’t have it. He insisted that an officer
must go first to test the working of it, and if all
went well to explain technically when he reached
the top what was the matter with us. As he was
the captain I had to go.’</p>

<p>Allison broke off and shuddered at the remembrance,
and it was some time before he continued.</p>

<p>‘I pushed up the lower lid and climbed into the
conning-tower, and as I held the flap I looked down
on the little crowd of upturned faces. “Good
luck, George,” said Belton, he always called me
George, “and good-bye.”</p>

<p>‘Then I closed the lid and stood there in the
narrow space with only the upper hatch between
me and 40 feet of water. I don’t quite know how
I felt, but I felt afraid, and I waited a minute before
I opened the sea-inlet, and the water poured into
the shaft. It was all dark, of course, and I had
the feeling that now at least I had burnt my boats.
The arrangement was that after I had gone up,
and the upper lid had been closed again from the
control room, they were to pump the shaft out
and the next man up would open the lower lid and
take my place, and they were to give me four
minutes to do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<p>‘The water rose up to my thighs, and in that
narrow space I could feel the air compressing terribly
on my ears and mouth, and I climbed up till my
head was touching the upper lid. Up came the
water again, up to my chest, and I waited with
one hand on the releasing gear of the lid.</p>

<p>‘When it reached my chin I couldn’t stand it
any longer and let the hatch fly. I don’t know
what happened then, but the bubble of compressed
air must have shot me clean up. I remember the
feeling of pressure and dark water and bursting
lungs, and then I was up in the glorious sunlight
that I hadn’t expected to see again.</p>

<p>‘Somebody grabbed me by the collar (I was
told afterwards it was the T.B.’s boat I was hauled
into), and I just managed to tell them how it was
with the poor devils below. Then I fainted and
came to in hospital, and that’s all about it.’</p>

<p>He drew a long breath.</p>

<p>‘The others?’ I hinted.</p>

<p>‘Oh, the tramp stood by, and her name and so
on was taken, but she wasn’t held to blame, as
nothing could be proved. Belton was the only
man who could have spoken, but, as you know,
they didn’t get the boat up for days.’</p>

<p>‘But why was it some of the others couldn’t
follow you up?’</p>

<p>‘Something must have gone wrong below. Either
they couldn’t drain the conning-tower or else the
gas got through to them. When they raised her
they were all gassed, poor beggars, and I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the doors must have leaked quicker than we’d
thought, and I just got up in time.’</p>

<p>‘You said something about a stoker being saved,
didn’t you?’</p>

<p>‘That was Howell, who was shut up in the engine-room.
It’s an interesting story how he got out.
He’s in Haslar Hospital now, if you’d like to go
and see him.’</p>

<p>I said I should like to very much.</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll give you this,’ and Allison wrote
something on the back of a card, ‘otherwise he
may suspect you and tell you nothing.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go,’ I said, taking the card. ‘His story
ought to be rather illuminating.’</p>

<p>‘It will be, I expect. You mustn’t mind his
language, though. He’s rather a hard nut.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t think I shall. I’m used to that sort of
thing after ten years close acquaintanceship with
the Navy.’</p>

<p>Allison laughed.</p>

<p>‘And are you,’ I suggested, ‘really going to stop
in submarines after an experience like that?’</p>

<p>‘Why not?’ he laughed again. ‘Because I’m
unlucky once it doesn’t follow that I will be
again.’</p>

<p>‘And the stoker?’</p>

<p>‘He’s coming back with me as a leading hand.
That is if he behaves himself,’ and he glanced at
the card in my hand.</p>

<p>‘But when it was all over and you were in the
hospital, how did you feel?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span></p>

<p>‘I felt a bit bad at first, and then I thought of
the rest of them down there, and I felt as if I wanted
a drink. The sister wouldn’t let me have one,
though, and we had a proper blarney,’ and he broke
off into some long story of the hospital.</p>

<p>I saw that it was no more use and that the golden
hour was passed. It was no good pressing it, and
I was thankful to have gleaned so much.</p>

<p>By-and-by he began to talk about his new boat
again.</p>

<p>‘In another month she ought to be ready for
trials,’ he said enthusiastically. ‘Hope you’ll
come and see how she behaves.’</p>

<p>‘I’d like to, but how about you? How will you
feel the first time you go down again?’</p>

<p>My host grinned.</p>

<p>‘Can’t say, I’m sure, but if you come, and mind
you’ve got to, I’ll let you know at the time, that is
if you remind me, and I’m not too busy with contractors’
people and dockyard officials and so on,
which I expect I shall be. Some of those dockyard
people are blighters, you can’t get half you want
out of them.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve noticed that,’ I answered. ‘Engineer-Commanders
are hard drivers of bargains sometimes.’</p>

<p>‘Hard drivers! Why I could tell you stories;
but no, there isn’t time. I’ve got a long day’s
work to-morrow, so I’ll turn in early. See you
before you leave?’</p>

<p>He rose to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>‘One moment,’ I said, ‘before bed, may I read
what you’ve written on this card?’</p>

<p>‘Good Heavens, yes,’ he laughed. ‘Good-night.’</p>

<p>On the card in my friend’s neat handwriting
were the words: ‘Tell him how you wrenched off
the manhole door or you won’t come back in <em>my</em>
boat.’</p>

<p>Such is the personal equation of the Naval
Officer.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>‘He’s in Ward 6,’ the sister told me. ‘Yes,
this is visitors’ hour, you’re not breaking the rules,’
and we smiled at each other as she led the way up
the cool stone staircase.</p>

<p>I found him sitting in an arm-chair, a young
man wrapped in a blanket of some sort, but haggard,
and, it may have been my imagination, rather
gray for his age.</p>

<p>He eyed me suspiciously, and I handed him the
magic card.</p>

<p>‘That’s Mr Hellison,’ he said, grinning broadly;
‘’e always was one for a joke like.’</p>

<p>I sat down and asked him how he was.</p>

<p>‘Not so ruddy,’ he answered, ‘but it give me
a fair turn, it did.’</p>

<p>‘And you’re stopping in submarines?’</p>

<p>‘All right, mate, I’ll earn it; I’ll carry out ’is
orders, and don’t you fret. I’m goin’ back as a
leadin’ ’and, I am.’</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>‘It was a fair old show,’ he went on presently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
‘but I come through it all right by a bit o’ luck.’</p>

<p>I congratulated him on his safety.</p>

<p>‘I was on watch in the engine-room, doin’ a job
of cleanin’, when it ’appened,’ he continued, ‘and
the E.R.A ’ad just gone for’ard for suthing when
the bump came. A proper old clang it was, and
I ’eard the water simply passing in, in a way o’
speakin’. Then the captain, ’e sung out for the
’ands to muster in the control room, but the lights
went out just then, and afore I could get out of the
engine-room some one banged the watertight door
to, and, as it ’appened, that’s wot saved my life.’</p>

<p>I nodded my interest in his story.</p>

<p>‘We was ’oled in the after compartment as well
as for’ard, you see, and them bangin’ that door
cut me off from the control room but kept out
the water that flooded in between the rest of the
bunch and me in the engine-room. I ’eard it risin’
after we ’it the bottom, and the boat took on a bit
of a cant.</p>

<p>‘Then I began to get in rather a sweat, as I knew
that if I was goin’ to be saved I got to save myself.
I come over all funny like at first down there in
the dark, and then I ’ad an idea and started right
on to work it.</p>

<p>‘First I got ’old of a shifting spanner and fell
to work on the man’ole of the No. 4 main ballast
tank. That’s under the engine-room, you know,
and when I’d got it off the water flopped in a bit
owin’ to the shape of the tank.</p>

<p>‘After that I sat down and wondered whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
it was worth it or if I could wait a bit and see if
they was goin’ to lift the boat, but the waitin’ got
on my nerves, and I thought I might as well see it
through. So I opened up the No. 4 Kingston, and
in come the water through the man’ole door what
I’d took off. It rose mighty fast, too, and after
it got over the Kingston wheel I knew it was neck
or nothin’, as they say, ’cos I could never stop the
water comin’ in again if I wanted to. So I climbed
up the ladder and ’ung on under the engine-room
’atch and watched the water risin’.</p>

<p>‘Of course the air compressed somethin’ cruel,
and when I thought it was enough I shoved away
the strong-back and tried to push the ’atch up.
It only lifted an inch or so and come down again
with a bang, lettin’ in a torrent of water that
knocked me off o’ the ladder, and I was swimmin’
about in the engine-room for a bit before I got ’old
of it again. The water was within two foot o’ the
roof by then and bangin’ me up against it, so I
thought ’ere goes, and I give the ’atch a push.
Lumme, I don’t rightly know <em>wot</em> ’appened then,
but I went up like a cork out of a bubbly bottle,
and never knew no more till I woke up one day
in this ’ere ’ospital. Mr Hellison, ’e come down and
see me, and I’m goin’ back with ’im, and that’s
all there is to it.’</p>

<p>The narrator drew a long breath, and paused to
watch the effect of his story.</p>

<p>‘Thanks,’ I said simply. There seemed nothing
else to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>He grinned broadly. ‘Wot do you think of it?’
he queried. ‘Sons of the sea and bloomin’ sky-blue
’eroes, wot?’</p>

<p>‘It must have been an awful experience,’ I
ventured.</p>

<p>‘Don’t you believe it, mate; “a life on the ocean
wave,” and honest Jack the sailor, that’s wot you
think,’ and he chuckled at some obscure joke.</p>

<p>‘I tell you, though, I was scared, mind yer.
Not at the time: I was too busy savin’ myself
then, but afterwards, lyin’ ’ere in bed; wot with
me bein’ weak and so on, I used to imagine I was
down there in the dark again, and I used to dream
about it and wake up in a sweat.’</p>

<p>‘And yet you’re stopping in submarines?’</p>

<p>‘You betcher. Did you ever, when you was a
little ’un, think you saw somethin’ in the dark
or feel that some one was be’ind you?’</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>‘Well, <em>I</em> used to, and my mother she always told
me, “Phil,” she used to say, “whenever you feels
like that, turn round and touch wot’s scarin’ you,
and when you feels nothin’ you’ll know it’s all
right.” It’s just the same as that. I’ll go back,
and once I’m in a boat again I’ll feel as right as a
trivet, it’s the bein’ away and thinkin’ that does
the damage.’</p>

<p>‘I think I see. You mean it’s the shadow that
hurts, not the substance.’</p>

<p>‘You’ve got it, guvnor; that’s wot it is. But ’ere’s
the sister comin’, so I guess you’ll ’ave to ’op it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span></p>

<p>‘Your time’s up,’ said the sister, smiling. ‘We
can’t allow him to talk too much, and he will keep
on talking.’</p>

<p>‘All right, sister, I’ll be a good boy,’ and the
patient lay back with closed eyes and snored loudly.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ I said, ‘and thanks so much for
what you’ve told me. Anything you’d like:
cigarettes and so on?’</p>

<p>‘No, thanks, guvnor, I’m all right,’ said the
sleeper, coming suddenly to life; ‘but if you’re
seein’ Mr Hellison, give ’im my respects and say
I’m ’opin’ to be with ’im before long.’</p>

<p>I promised that I would.</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ I said again, ‘and best of luck and a
quick recovery.’</p>

<p>The sister was waiting for me at the door, and
beckoned impatiently.</p>

<p>As I left the ward I glanced once more towards
the patient. He was apparently sound asleep
and snoring his loudest, but as I turned away, one
eye suddenly opened and closed again in the most
unmistakable wink that was ever winked by man
or sailor.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It wasn’t until some years afterwards that I
heard the end of the story.</p>

<p>I only got wind of it by chance at a dinner party,
after the women folk had left us and the port had
been round for the second time. It was before
the War, and not knowing that there were any
Naval guests present I was talking to my neighbour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
about the Navy, and telling him what I knew of
the ‘02’ fatality, when the gray-haired man opposite
me broke in.</p>

<p>‘I think I can finish your story for you,’ he
said.</p>

<p>‘Finish the story!’ I replied in surprise. ‘Do
you know any more details then?’</p>

<p>‘I think I do,’ he said quietly. ‘You see, I was
in the T.B. at the time of the accident. I was a
captain then, and it was before I retired from the
Service, and I went out to see what a periscope
looked like, and to prove some of my own pet
theories as to the uselessness of these new-fangled
things called submarines.’</p>

<p>‘Do tell me,’ I pleaded. ‘I’ll be very quiet if
you will.’</p>

<p>‘It’s not a pleasant tale, though. I don’t know
<span class="locked">if——’</span></p>

<p>But the other guests, who had heard my account
of the survivors’ experiences, clamoured for the
story, and the gray-haired man gave way.</p>

<p>‘I went out in the T.B. as a sight-seer, and watched
the submarine dive through my glasses with the
interest of a child with a new toy. It was the
first time I’d seen a boat go under, and I remember
wondering what it felt like to be down below. At
the same time I noticed a tramp steamer, a Norwegian
she was, coming down Channel across our
track, and I recollected mentioning it to the captain
of the Torpedo Boat.</p>

<p>‘We hoisted a red flag to indicate the danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
and continued on our course, keeping a good look-out
for the periscope meanwhile, and all the time the
tramp kept getting closer and didn’t seem to worry
about our warning signals. Then the periscope
was spotted, and the next moment the tramp was
between us and the submarine’s track. At the
last minute the Norwegian seemed to have suddenly
realised that something was wrong, and thinking
the danger was to do with us, altered her course
away from us.</p>

<p>‘Even so, something must have been amiss in
the boat, or I think she would have gone clear,
but the next moment we saw the wake of the
periscope under the steamer’s counter, and then
it disappeared for good. The Norwegian stopped
in answer to our frantic signals, and we went
alongside and hailed the master. He said that
his engineers reported that the propeller had
struck something, so we took his name and port of
registry and got the wireless going.</p>

<p>‘Two T.B.s arrived in a short time with divers
and other gear, and the tramp was taken into
Portland for examination; but nothing was proved,
and she was not held to blame. In those days the
submarine signals weren’t generally known as
they are now.</p>

<p>‘We’d marked and buoyed the spot where we
last saw “02’s” periscope, and the divers were
just getting ready for a preliminary survey when
a man shot out of the water and right up in the
air. He fell back with a plop, and we had a boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
out and the body on board inside three minutes.
It was Allison, the “Sub” of the boat, and he
just managed to tell us how things were and what
had happened before he fainted. Then the divers
got to work, and we were waiting anxiously for
news when another body appeared. It was one
of the stokers, and he was in a bad condition with
shock, and half drowned. We waited and waited,
but nobody else came up, and it was not for days
afterwards that the boat was raised, and they
were all dead by <span class="locked">then——’</span></p>

<p>The gray-haired man sighed and broke off.</p>

<p>‘I knew Allison,’ I said, breaking the silence
that followed. ‘It was he who told me practically
all I know about “02.”’</p>

<p>‘Did you?’ said the gray-haired man; ‘and I
knew Belton: I knew him very well.’</p>

<p>‘I’m so sorry,’ I said, ‘I hope I <span class="locked">haven’t——’</span></p>

<p>‘Not at all,’ replied my informant. ‘But I think
I knew him better than most people, because, you
see, he was my son.’</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>I went home that night and I thought about
it. Of Allison the cheery, and Howell the Cockney,
and of that lonely old Admiral who’d seen his son
die. I thought about it and I wondered. And
the result was that I asked myself this question:
‘Why do these men do this, and what keeps them
doing it?’ And then the answer came, and the
answer is, that in spite of modern machinery,
and modern scepticism, and modern commercialism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
and all the money grubbing and scoffing of the
twentieth century, there is still, thank God, a
touch of the loyalty and ideal of honour and
patriotism that nerved our fathers of the middle
ages. In the ordinary walks of life it is met with
but rarely, or if it does exist, it is denied and held
to scorn by those who would rather strike in war-time
than do an extra hour’s work, and hold self
continually in the fore-ground and never cast a
thought to State or Country.</p>

<p>And that loyalty and those ideals are always
met with in the Navy and the Army, ay, and in
the Merchant Service too—that Service who has
found her worth and come into her own since this
World War began.</p>

<p>And why should these ideals remain in our
Services when they have so long left the ranks of
civilian life? For the reason that the men of the
Services are trained in the same old way and
live up to the same ideals as their fathers of
centuries ago; only a few of the details have been
altered.</p>

<p>For on joining the colours, whether White Ensign
or Red Ensign, or his regimental banner, the man
whose father may be an agitator or a strike leader
learns to forget himself and to work for his surroundings,
for good work’s sake, and for the opinion
of his superiors.</p>

<p>Thank God that it is so, and that there were
those among us who came forward in 1914 and in
1915 without having to be cajoled and eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
forced to do what was our obvious and common
duty.</p>

<p>May those who growl at the War and those who
ask, as some have been asking, ‘What is the Navy
doing?’ gather from these few pages a glimpse of
the life of one small branch of the Service to which
Britain owes her immunity. And if they are not
silent afterwards, then will it be proof that the
spirit of England is on the wane, and that her manhood
is not what it was in the days of Trafalgar
and of Waterloo.</p>

<p>May that day never come, and may Englishmen,
ay, and Irishmen, too, when striving to do their
duty look to the Navy and her sister Services for
their guide-star and example.</p>

<p class="p2 center">AMEN.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE JERVAISE COMEDY</p>

<p class="adauthor">By J. D. BERESFORD</p>

<p class="in0 adauthorof">(Author of ‘<span class="smcap">God’s Counterpoint</span>’)</p>

<p class="adbody"><i>The Jervaise Comedy</i> is one of Mr Beresford’s lighter books, and
the whole action is played within twenty-four hours. Nevertheless,
within that time the principal person of the story meets with a series
of adventures that changes his whole way of life; while the crisis with
which the book opens determines the career of one, at least, of the
members of the Jervaise family in whose country house the scene is laid.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE SEEKERS</p>

<p class="adauthor">By HUGH F. SPENDER</p>

<p class="in0 adauthorof">(Author of ‘<span class="smcap">The Gulf</span>’)</p>

<p class="adbody">This is a novel dealing with Spiritualism, and the pernicious effects of
seances and spook-hunting are illustrated in the history of John Havering.
He is one among many ‘Seekers’ in the book, who all in their way
endeavour to solve the mystery of the future life. The story has a
romantic interest in the love affairs of Irene Hoey and Mary Havering,
two strongly contrasted characters, and the plot involves a mysterious
murder, which gives the excitement of a detective story to the book.
There is also a political interest in <i>The Seekers</i> in the career of Ernest
Beaufort, the Leader of the ‘People’s Party’; while the religious interest
is to be found in the characters of the Vicar of Siltrop, Peter Silas the
Quaker, and Mary Havering.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE GRAFTONS</p>

<p class="adauthor">By ARCHIBALD MARSHALL</p>

<p class="adbody">The Grafton family, settled happily in their beautiful country home,
Abington Abbey, have reached the point in life where matrimonial developments
may be expected to change its easy flow. The father is a well-preserved
widower of fifty; two of the daughters are grown up. The
story chiefly concerns their love affairs, but deals also with their country
neighbours, and the give and take of English country life just before the
war. The country around the village of Abington is well supplied with
large houses, rectories, and vicarages, and from each of them, as well as
from the greater world of London, come people, old and young, agreeable
and disagreeable, to play their part in the comedy that centres around the
Graftons. The novel also contains scenes laid in Paris, and one in the
mountains of Switzerland.</p>

<p class="adtitle">WITHIN THE RIM</p>

<p class="adauthor">By HENRY JAMES</p>

<p class="in0 adauthorof">(Author of ‘<span class="smcap">The Ivory Tower</span>,’ ‘<span class="smcap">The Sense of the Past</span>,’ etc., etc.)</p>

<p class="adbody">The assumption by Henry James of British citizenship was a symbolic
act, a unique demonstration to all the world of his devotion to the Allied
cause. To that cause also he dedicated the last efforts of his genius. In
these moving, poignant pages, the heroism of ravaged Belgium and Fiance,
the war effort of Britain, the rich outflow of American philanthropy are
enshrined with all the master’s old matchless beauty of thought and form.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE SKELETON KEY</p>

<p class="adauthor">By BERNARD CAPES</p>

<p class="in0 adauthorof">(Author of ‘<span class="smcap">Where England Sets Her Feet</span>’)</p>

<p class="adbody">This story deals with a crime committed in the grounds of a country
house, and the subsequent efforts of a clever young detective to discover
the perpetrator. There is an amusing love interest and strong characterisation.
The scene is laid in Paris and Hampshire.</p>

<p class="adtitle">MR. MISFORTUNATE</p>

<p class="adauthor">By MARJORIE BOWEN</p>

<p class="in0 adauthorof">(Author of ‘<span class="smcap">The Burning Glass</span>’)</p>

<p class="adbody">The story is of <i>Young Mr. Misfortunate</i> (as Charles Edward
Stewart was styled by the Whigs of his time) after the disaster of the ’45
Scottish Expedition to his meeting with Clementina Walkinshaw in 1753.</p>

<p class="adbody">It opens in Scotland, but is mainly placed in Paris and its environs,
in palace and slum, with one change to Venice.</p>

<p class="adbody">The theme is the little known adventures that led to the downfall of
a cause and a man—the most lovable and unfortunate of all the lovable and
unfortunate Stewarts.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE ADVENTURESS</p>

<p class="adauthor">By ARTHUR B. REEVE</p>

<p class="adbody">An American from Maddox Munitions, Incorporated, the owners of a
new war invention—the telautomaton, forms the centre round which this
exciting mystery tale is built. In trying to answer the ever-present question
‘Who killed Marshall Maddox?’ the reader is tossed about a sea of conjecture
by two strong main currents which continually cross and recross
each other and keep him mystified till the end of the book. Scientific
inventiveness—at times diabolical in its ruthless ingeniousness, plays no
less strong a part than does Paquita, the adventuress. Was the death of
Maddox retributive for his double life or was it due to the covetousness of
some schemer. It required a detective of Craig Kennedy’s acumen to
discover.</p>

<p class="adtitle">UNDER THE PERISCOPE</p>

<p class="adauthor">By LIEUT. MARK BENNETT, R.N.R.</p>

<p class="adbody">A realistic and detailed picture of life on a submarine during the war,
including descriptions of the construction and management of the boat, and
the effect of submarine conditions on the crew. All the incidents recorded
are founded on fact, and most of them are personal experiences of the author.</p>

<p class="adtitle">HIS DAUGHTER</p>

<p class="adauthor">By GOUVERNEUR MORRIS</p>

<p class="adbody">This is the story of an American whose nature is refined in the fire
of war. It begins in the easy-going days of travel abroad when young
Dayton meets Elizabeth Brown and becomes informally engaged; and goes
on to the artist life in Paris when he meets Elise, a joyous young Parisian
girl of the lower class. Suddenly called home and prevented by accident
from communicating with Elise, he marries Elizabeth with the determination
to be true to her. Chance takes him to Paris, and there three things
happened: he learns of another daughter, the child of Elise; Maria,
Elizabeth’s daughter, dies of typhoid; and the Germans strike. Both he
and his loyal wife plunge into the war, and in the ordeals which there
confront them the dross of his nature is destroyed.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE MAN FROM AUSTRALIA</p>

<p class="adauthor">By KATHARINE TYNAN</p>

<p class="adbody"><i>The Man from Australia</i> is the story of John Darling, who comes
from the Antipodes to find his Irish cousins. How he finds them amid
tragic circumstances: how he loves his cousin Aileen, over whom the
clouds of tragedy hang darkest: how he loses and finds her, is the main
theme of the story. The setting is in the Wild West of Ireland.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE FLOWER OF THE CHAPDELAINES</p>

<p class="adauthor">By GEORGE W. CABLE</p>

<p class="adbody">The scene is the ‘Vieux Carré’ of New Orleans, the last lingering
place of the old Creole atmosphere. There Geoffry Chester, a young
lawyer, is struck by the charm of a Creole beauty whom he daily meets on
his way to the office. This is a case of love at first sight. On account of
the exclusive character of the Creole coterie it seems destined to be limited
to sight, but a bookseller consults him about an old manuscript of which
Aline Chapdelaines is the owner. The fate of this manuscript in respect to
publication and of Chester in regard to matrimony is the theme of a most
original romance.</p>

<p class="adtitle">HERITAGE</p>

<p class="adauthor">By V. SACKVILLE-WEST</p>

<p class="adbody">Miss V. Sackville-West is already well known as a writer of distinguished
verse, but this is her first essay in fiction. Her subject is the
influence of heredity, and shows the effect of a strain of Spanish blood on
a stolid Sussex stock, as manifested in the persons of a young woman and
her cousin, whom she subsequently marries. The story has most unusual
literary and dramatic values; but while it is first of all remarkable for its
literary style, its beautiful descriptions and power of creative imagination, it
presents against this background a steadfast realism of action and psychology.
The biological parallel of the ‘waltzing mice’ that in some sense follow the
fortunes of the heroine is an original and charming invention. <i>Heritage</i>
is certainly one of the most arresting first novels published in the last ten
years.</p>

<p class="adtitle">THE CARAVAN MAN</p>

<p class="adauthor">By ERNEST GOODWIN</p>

<p class="adbody">For the right sort of people, Life, in even these drab times, holds
romance and beauty, fun and whimsical adventure. Bamfield, camping in
his caravan on Ouseton Common, found himself involved in a whirlpool of
surprising events. He had imagined himself quite a serious person, immovably
a bachelor wedded to art. ‘Oh! Indeed!’ Fate seems to have
chuckled to itself, and proceeded to deal with him in the proper manner.
At the finish, Bamfield, giddy, breathless (perhaps in his secret soul a trifle
alarmed), discovered that he was holding Rose Nieugent by the hand—and
holding her tight!</p>

The setting is, for the most part, in pre-war England, and a countryside
which will probably never be the same again.</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
